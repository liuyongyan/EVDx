PRJNA400356,SRR5983012,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Lung adenocarcinoma,-,2018-02-15,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29344346/,"Extracellular vesicles from plasma were isolated using Ribo™ Exosome Isolation Reagent (CAT. NO. C10110-2, Ribobio, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First, plasma samples were centrifuged at 2000g at room temperature for 20 min to remove residual cells and debris, and then the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged at 10,000g at room temperature for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and mixed adequately with 1/3 volume isolation reagent, and the mixture was placed at 4 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000g at 4 °C for 2 min. Finally, the supernatant was removed and the EV pellet was recovered by re-suspending in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",Homo sapiens (human),"Exosomes play important roles in intercellular communication through the delivery of their cargoes, which include proteins, lipids, and RNAs. Increasingly, multiple studies have reported the association between exosomal small non-coding RNAs and cancer, due to their regulatory functions in gene expression. Hence, analysis of the features of small non-coding RNA expression and their incorporation into exosomes is important for cancer research. Here, we performed deep sequencing to investigate the expression of small RNAs in plasma exosomes from lung adenocarcinoma patients, lung squamous cell carcinoma patients, and healthy controls. We found that 5’ YRNA hY4-derived fragments are significantly upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exosomes, and may serve as a novel class of circulating biomarkers for NSCLC diagnosis. We also identified that the RNY4P7 gene on chromosome 2 may not be a pseudogene, because the corresponding transcript hY4 reverse fragment was detected in exosomes and cells. Further, we demonstrated that a panel of small RNAs, including miR-451a and miR-122-5p, may be selectively sorted into NSCLC exosomes. Overall, our studies have indicated a wider range of biological effects in NSCLC that may be mediated by exosomal small RNAs than previously known.
Overall design: The small RNA in the plasma exosomes from 28 lung adenocarcinoma patients (ADC), 13 lung squamous cell carcinoma patients (SQCC), and 13 healthy individuals (CTRL) were analyzed by high through-put RNA Sequencing. All patients were characterized by clinical stage, and peripheral blood samples were collected before treatment. To minimize differences between individuals, RNA samples from same group were pooled together in a fixed ratio before deep sequencing. All the sequencing data was normalized as RPM (mapped reads per million clean reads)."
