The supernatant was collected from cells that were cultured in media containing 10% EV-depleted FBS, 50 ng/mL SCF, 20 ng/mL TPO, 40 ng/mL FLT3L and 20 ng/mL IL-3 for 72 h and subsequently subjected to sequential centrifugation at 800×g for 5 min and 2,000×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was then filtered using 0.22-μm filters, and a pellet was recovered at 100,000×g in a SW32 Ti rotor after 1 h and 10 min of ultracentrifugation (Beckman). The supernatant was aspirated, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS and subsequently ultracentrifuged at 100,000×g for another 1 h and 10 min.

The miRNA profile in EVs from MDS patients was distinctly clustered from that in healthy individuals. In addition, the miRNAs significantly upregulated in the MDS group target pathways linked to cell survival, proliferation, and MSC differentiation, indicating that they have remarkably similar properties to miRNAs in murine EVs from MDS cells. These results suggest that miRNAs play an essential role in the MSC impairment observed in MDS.
