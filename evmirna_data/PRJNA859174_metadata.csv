The sEVs isolation was performed using SEC with minor modifications. In short, 1 mL of plasma sample filtered through a 0.8-μm microporous membrane filter was transferred to an Exosupur® column (Echobiotech, Beijing, China). Elusion was performed using PBS, and 2 mL of eluate was collected following the manufacturer’s instructions. The fractions were collected by filtering through a 100-kD molecular weight cutoff spin column of Amicon® Ultra spin filters (Merck, Germany) to a final volume of 200 µL.

In the present study, we aimed to identify serum small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived microRNAs (miRNAs) from the serum samples of children for Tic Disorders Diagnosis
Overall design: Expression of circulating miRNAs  from serum sEVs between Tic Disorders and healthy  children was assessed in this multiphase case-control study.
