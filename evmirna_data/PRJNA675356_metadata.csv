A comparative bulk sequence analysis of miRNAs from CCND2WTExos and CCND2OEExos (exosomes from wild type hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) was performed to identify some underlying mechanisms about proliferation induction.
Overall design: Examination of 2 different miRNA profiles in CCND2WTExos and CCND2OEExos"
