PRJNA890886,SRR21914390,sEV,Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)|Primary cell,-,-,2022-10-15,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37535897/,"HUVECs were cultured in medium supplemented with 5% FBS depleted of EVs (ViVaCell, Shanghai, China, C3801-0050) for a duration of 48 h. In order to eliminate cells, apoptotic bodies, and cell fragments, the supernatant underwent centrifugation at 500g for 10 min, followed by 2000g for 20 min and finally 5000g for 30 min. Following the passage through a 0.2 μm filter, EVs were gathered using a SW32 Ti rotor l-100xp ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, CA) through centrifugation at 130000g for 2 h. Subsequently, the sediment was resuspended in PBS and subjected to another 2 h centrifugation at 130000g to eliminate any impure protein.",miRNA-seq of extracellular vesicles detracted from HUVECs,We performed bulk miRNA sequencing on the extracellular vesicles detracted from primary HUVECs
