Briefly, blood samples collected into heparinized tubes were centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min, and plasma specimens were stored in 1-mL aliquots at –80 °C. Then, the EVs were isolated by the Total Exosome Isolation Kit. Briefly, plasmas were centrifuged at 1000 g for 20 min, 3000 g for 20 min, and 10 000 g for 20 min. Then, 1 mL of clarified plasma was transferred to a new tube and 0.5 volumes of 1× PBS was added. After mixing the sample thoroughly by vortexing, 0.2 volumes (i.e., Total volume = plasma + PBS) of the exosome precipitation reagent (from plasma) was added. Then, the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and followed by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 5 min. After the supernatant was discarded by pipetting, the pellet (EVs) was resuspended in 200 µL of 1× PBS for downstream analysis.",High throughput sequencing analyzes small RNA profile alteration in the exosomes from lung cancer patients and healthy controls (human),"Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the small RNA expression profiles in the peripheral exosomes and try to find biomarkers for early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma
Methods: Exosome was extracted from peripherial blood samples from 5 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 5 healthy controls. RNA was extracted and microRNA profile was analyzed by high througput sequencing.
Results: The expression of 5 microRNAs was found significantly altered in patients with lung adenocarcinoma
Overall design: Examination of peripheral blood exosome microRNAs from 5 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 5 healthy controls"
