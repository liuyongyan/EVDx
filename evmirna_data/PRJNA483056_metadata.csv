Following the overnight incubation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fresh media containing exosome-free fetal bovine serum (#A2720801, Gibco) applied. Cells were incubated for 48 h under standard conditions. After 48 h, the media was collected and vesicles isolated using the exoEasy Maxi kit (#76064, Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and gravity flow chromatography (#qEV, Izon Science, Oxford, UK) following the manufacturers’ protocols to isolate vesicles of less than 200 nm and within the range considered to represent exosomes.",Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis (human),"Analysis of miRNA and mRNA within extracellular vesicles obtained from prostate cancer PC3 cells.
