Methods: Placental and Placental vesicles (STB-EVs)  smallRNA profiles of normal and preeclamptic patients were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HISEQ. FASTq.gz files were compressed with OASIS compressor and alignment was done with OASIS 2.0 ( by trimmimng with trimmomatic, aligning using default OASIS 2.0 aligning papameters). Quantitative PCR validation was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays
Results: This  contains a set of three parallel smallRNA sequencing experiments involving placenta tissue, medium/large STB-EVs and small STB-EVs. Comparison between PE and normal pregnancy placental tissue revealed 134 (p-value of <0.05 ) while in medium/large STB-EVs, 101 and in small STB-EVs, 16  (adjusted P-value of <0.05) differentially expressed small RNA  We identified a number of mechanistic and biomarker targets,  which were validated with qRT–PCR and confirmed to be signifficantly DE. The differentially expressed analysis identified potential yet undescribed small RNAs that may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia or/and may act as biomarkers of the disease.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first combined analysis of placenta, medium/large and small STB-EV transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results identified potential Placenta EV small RNA biomarkers that can help diagnose the preeclampsia

Methods: Placental and Placental vesicles (STB-EVs)  smallRNA profiles of normal and preeclamptic patients were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HISEQ. FASTq.gz files were compressed with OASIS compressor and alignment was done with OASIS 2.0 ( by trimmimng with trimmomatic, aligning using default OASIS 2.0 aligning papameters). Quantitative PCR validation was performed using TaqMan gene expression assays
Results: This  contains a set of three parallel smallRNA sequencing experiments involving placenta tissue, medium/large STB-EVs and small STB-EVs. Comparison between PE and normal pregnancy placental tissue revealed 134 (p-value of <0.05 ) while in medium/large STB-EVs, 101 and in small STB-EVs, 16  (adjusted P-value of <0.05) differentially expressed small RNA  We identified a number of mechanistic and biomarker targets,  which were validated with qRT–PCR and confirmed to be signifficantly DE. The differentially expressed analysis identified potential yet undescribed small RNAs that may contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia or/and may act as biomarkers of the disease.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first combined analysis of placenta, medium/large and small STB-EV transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology.
