PRJNA814986,SRR18309058,sEV,Primary cell|human mesenchymal stem cell,-,-,2022-04-27,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35585987/,"The isolated EVs were characterized for number and size distribution and presence of membrane markers by nano tracking analysis (NTA) and immunoblotting. For NTA, a 1/100 dilution of the EV suspension was analyzed in the Nanosight NS-300 instrument to obtain the average number of particles and the size distribution plot. Based on the NTA results, approximately equal concentration of control and TNFα EVs (1.8x1010 particles/ml) were used for each experiment.",miRNA sequencing of human mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles,To compare the miRNA profiles of extracellular vesicles from naive MSCs and TNF-alpha preconditioned MSCs
