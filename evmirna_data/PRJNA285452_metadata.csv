PRJNA285452,SRR2046408,sEV,Cell line|Cell line/SCC-9|Tongue,Tongue squamous cell carcinoma,-,2015-06-11,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34186243/,"EVs were isolated through differential centrifugation based on previous methodology [22]. Briefly, SCC-9 and LN1 cells were cultured until 80% cell confluence in 150-mm-diameter plates, washed three times with PBS, and further cultivated for 48 h in media without fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After serum deprivation treatment, the conditioned media (200 ml) was collected and centrifuged at 200g for 5 min, 2000g for 15 min, 3500g for 30 min, and 10,000g for 90 min. The cleared supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 90 min at 4 °C, and vesicle-containing pellets were washed with PBS by ultracentrifugation for 1.5 h at the same speed. The samples were stored at −80 °C until further use.
