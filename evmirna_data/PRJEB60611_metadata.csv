PRJEB60611,ERR11011318,sEV,Blood|Serum,Gastric cancer,-,2023-11-02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37415735/,"Exosomes were first isolated from serum using ExoQuick™ (System Biosciences, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 300 μl of cell-free serum samples were transferred to a tube and mixed with 75 μl of ExoQuick reagent. Next, the mixture was incubated at 4°C overnight and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 30 min. Then, the pelleted exosomes were resuspended in 40 μl PBS.",RNA-seq of non coding RNA from serum exosomes of GC patients and healthy individuals,The dysregulation of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the development and progression of cancer. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in serum exosomes of GC patients and healthy individuals using next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics.
