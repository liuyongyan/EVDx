Urine was storage at − 80 °C with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) until analyses. Urine was centrifuged at 4 °C at 1000×g for 15 min to eliminate the cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 17,000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then filtered with a 0.22 μm filter and ultracentrifuged at 200,000×g for 1 h at 4 °C in a ultracentrifuge Thermo-Sorvall WX80+ (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Asheville, NC, USA) with a TH-660 swinging bucket rotor (K factor = 82.6).

Our aim was to identify miRNAs within urinary exosomes associated to the NC-AME phenotype. A total of 18 urine samples (9 control and 9 NC-AME) derived from adult and children subjects were analyzed using small RNA sequencing.
Overall design: miRNAs were profiled from urinary exosomes using next generation sequencing (Illumina NextSeq 500 platform)."
