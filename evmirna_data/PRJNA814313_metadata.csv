Briefly, the serum samples were passed through a filter (0.8 μm pore size, product no.: SLAA033SB; Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States) to exclude large particles. An equivalent volume of kit buffer XBP was then added to 500 μl of the sample, followed by five inversions. The mixture was then added to an exoEasy spin column and centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min at room temperature. After the flow-through was discarded, 10 ml of buffer XWP was added to the column and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to remove residual buffer in the column. The column was then transferred to a fresh collection tube, 400 μl of buffer XE was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 min. The collection tube was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to collect the eluate.",Circulating exosomal microRNAs contribute to the antimigraine effects of acupuncture (human),"We conducted this study to determine whether exosome regulation underlies the antimigraine mechanisms of acupuncture. By comparing serum samples from patients with migraine and healthy controls using high-throughput small RNA sequencing technology , we identified 705 exosomal microRNAs that are differentially expressed in patients with migraine, and this set of 705 microRNAs included five that are particularly well characterised (hsa-miR-369-5p, hsa-miR-1268b, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-222-5p, and hsa-miR-4488). By comparing serum samples collected from patients with migraine before and after acupuncture treatment, we showed that acupuncture normalised the expression levels of those five well-characterised exosomal microRNAs.
Overall design: We compared differential expressed serum-derived exosomal miRNAs between the migraine patients group and healthy controls. And we compared differential expressed serum-derived exosomal miRNAs in migraine patients before and after acupuncture"

Briefly, the serum samples were passed through a filter (0.8 μm pore size, product no.: SLAA033SB; Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States) to exclude large particles. An equivalent volume of kit buffer XBP was then added to 500 μl of the sample, followed by five inversions. The mixture was then added to an exoEasy spin column and centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min at room temperature. After the flow-through was discarded, 10 ml of buffer XWP was added to the column and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to remove residual buffer in the column. The column was then transferred to a fresh collection tube, 400 μl of buffer XE was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 min. The collection tube was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to collect the eluate.",Circulating exosomal microRNAs contribute to the antimigraine effects of acupuncture (human),"We conducted this study to determine whether exosome regulation underlies the antimigraine mechanisms of acupuncture. By comparing serum samples from patients with migraine and healthy controls using high-throughput small RNA sequencing technology , we identified 705 exosomal microRNAs that are differentially expressed in patients with migraine, and this set of 705 microRNAs included five that are particularly well characterised (hsa-miR-369-5p, hsa-miR-1268b, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-miR-222-5p, and hsa-miR-4488). By comparing serum samples collected from patients with migraine before and after acupuncture treatment, we showed that acupuncture normalised the expression levels of those five well-characterised exosomal microRNAs.
