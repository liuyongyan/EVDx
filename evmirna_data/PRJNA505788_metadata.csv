Briefly, each saliva (2 mL) and urine (10 mL) sample was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2,000×g at 4°C to remove any cells or cellular debris, after which the resultant supernatant was centrifuged for 45 minutes at 12,000×g at 4°C to remove any smaller debris or cellular organelles. The supernatant was then spun in a L8-60M ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) using a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor for 75 minutes at 160,000×g at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, pellet was resuspended in 20 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), filtered through a 0.2μm filter, gently pipetted on top of 4 mL Tris/sucrose/D2O solution (30% sucrose cushion), and centrifuged for 75 min at 100,000×g at 4°C using a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor. A 5 mL syringe fitted with an 18-G needle was used to collect approximately 3.0 mL of the sucrose cushion from the side of the ultracentrifuge tube. The aspirate was then transferred to a fresh ultracentrifuge tube, diluted to 60 mL with PBS, and centrifuged for 70 minutes at 100,000×g at 4°C using a 45Ti fixed-angle rotor. The sEV pellet was resuspended in 100 μL PBS and stored at -80ºC for downstream analysis.

The objective of this study was to determine the similarities and differences between sEV ncRNA derived from saliva, serum and urine, as well as cell-free ncRNA from serum. Saliva, urine and serum were concomitantly collected from 4 healthy donors, and sEV were isolated from each respective biofluid, along with cfRNA from serum. sEVs were isolated from the respective biofluids via differential ultracentrifugation. Small RNA-sequencing was performed on each sample, and cluster analysis was performed based on ncRNA profiles. While some similarities existed in terms of sEV ncRNA cargo across biofluids, there are also notable differences in ncRNA class and ncRNA secretion, with each sEVs in each biofluid bearing a unique ncRNA profile. We conclude that sEV ncRNA cargo varies according to biofluid, so thus should be carefully selected and interpreted when designing translational or epidemiological studies.

The objective of this study was to determine the similarities and differences between sEV ncRNA derived from saliva, serum and urine, as well as cell-free ncRNA from serum. Saliva, urine and serum were concomitantly collected from 4 healthy donors, and sEV were isolated from each respective biofluid, along with cfRNA from serum. sEVs were isolated from the respective biofluids via differential ultracentrifugation. Small RNA-sequencing was performed on each sample, and cluster analysis was performed based on ncRNA profiles. While some similarities existed in terms of sEV ncRNA cargo across biofluids, there are also notable differences in ncRNA class and ncRNA secretion, with each sEVs in each biofluid bearing a unique ncRNA profile. We conclude that sEV ncRNA cargo varies according to biofluid, so thus should be carefully selected and interpreted when designing translational or epidemiological studies.

Briefly, each saliva (2 mL) and urine (10 mL) sample was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 2,000×g at 4°C to remove any cells or cellular debris, after which the resultant supernatant was centrifuged for 45 minutes at 12,000×g at 4°C to remove any smaller debris or cellular organelles. The supernatant was then spun in a L8-60M ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) using a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor for 75 minutes at 160,000×g at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, pellet was resuspended in 20 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), filtered through a 0.2μm filter, gently pipetted on top of 4 mL Tris/sucrose/D2O solution (30% sucrose cushion), and centrifuged for 75 min at 100,000×g at 4°C using a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor. A 5 mL syringe fitted with an 18-G needle was used to collect approximately 3.0 mL of the sucrose cushion from the side of the ultracentrifuge tube. The aspirate was then transferred to a fresh ultracentrifuge tube, diluted to 60 mL with PBS, and centrifuged for 70 minutes at 100,000×g at 4°C using a 45Ti fixed-angle rotor. The sEV pellet was resuspended in 100 μL PBS and stored at -80ºC for downstream analysis.
