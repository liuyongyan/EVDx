Method:A total of 182 pregnant women including 91 VSD cases and 91 matched controls were included in this study. Exosomes were isolated and  next-generation sequencing was used to obtain a profile of dysregulated exosomal miRNA. The differential abundance was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (q RT-PCR). . Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted  to evaluate the diagnostic accucary
Results: 77 serum exosomal miRNA were uncovered to be differentially expressed in the VSD group as compared to the control group. Among these, five down-regulated exosomal miRNA were validated by qRT-PCR. hsa-miR-146a-5p was identified to be capable of distinguishing VSDs from controls (area under the ROC (AUC): 0.997; p < 2.2e-16).
Conclusion: circulating exosomal miRNA, in particular, hsa-miR-146a-5pmay be a predictive biomarker for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal VSDs.
Overall design: Maternal circulating exosomal miRNAs profiles of ventricular Septal Defect and control."
