PRJNA943559,SRR23823978,sEV,GWI-iCPPs (cardiopulmonary progenitor cell)|Primary cell,-,-,2023-03-13,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA943559/,"Venous blood was collected in the morning after an overnight fast and plasma was separated. Exosomes were isolated from plasma using an ultracentrifuge (CP100MX, Hitachi, Japan). Plasma was first centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C to remove larger vesicles. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane to eliminate larger particles and then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 70 min at 4 °C. The resulting particles were resuspended in 10 mL of pre-chilled PBS and subjected to another centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 70 min at 4 °C. The collected precipitate represented exosomes after removing the supernatant. ",Reprogrammed cardiopulmonary progenitor cell derived exosomes alleviate acute lung injury,"In order to explore the function of iCPPs derived exosomes, we analyzed the miRNAs in exosomes."
