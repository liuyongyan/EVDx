Exosomes from cell culture were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation72. Briefly, conditioned medium harvested from cell culture was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove cells. Exosomes were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 20 min to remove microvesicles. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.2-μm filter to remove particles larger than 200 nm. Exosomes were then collected by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 × g for 70 min. Pellets were washed in PBS and centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 70 min and finally suspended in PBS. The exosomes isolated by ExoQuick and sequential ultracentrifugation were confirmed to be identical in both morphologically and functionally.",microRNA expression in serum exosomes from Caucasian and African American breast cancer patients (human),"There is drastic racial disparities between Caucasian (CA) and African American (AA) for breast cancer. Circulating microRNAs exhibit stability and may serve as biomarkers in clinical settings. To discover potential microRNAs that mediate intercellular crosstalk and as biomarkers underlying the breast cancer racial disparity, serum exosomes from CA and AA were extracted and analyzed for its microRNA contents using small RNA sequencing.
Overall design: Exosomes from 6 pooled serum samples each from CA and AA cancer patients were isolated by Exoquick. RNA were isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to library construction and Illumina sequencing."
