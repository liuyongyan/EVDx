Therefore, it is of paramount importance to preoperative estimate the likelihood of R0 resection for choosing the best therapeutic strategy. Our study aimed to develop a non-invasive and reliable detection method for AOC patients with a high risk of residual disease. An integrated plasma small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) microRNA profiling was generated by RNA sequencing in AOC patients with no residual disease patients (R0) and residual disease(non-R0). We identified and validated a logistic model based on plasma sEVs miRNAs to predict residual disease in AOC patients.
