Isolated exosome imaging was undertaken using transmission electron microscopy, and Nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to measure the size distribution and concentration of exosomes. Exosome biomarkers were detected by western blotting.",Gastric cancer cells treated with exosomes derived from Fusobacterium nucleatum infected MKN-28 cells [miRNA-seq] (human),"To investigate the role of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in the development of gastric cancer, we extracted exosomes from the culture supernatant of MKN-28 cells treated with Fn or PBS, co-cultured them with AGS cells, and analyzed their miRNA-seq data for gene expression profiling.
Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of miRNA-seq data for AGS cells treated with Fn49256-GCEx or GCEx."
