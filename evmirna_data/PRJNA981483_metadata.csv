Briefly, the serum was obtained by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min to remove the cell debris and platelets. Microvesicles were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 30 min, after which the exosomes were further purified from the supernatant by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Following isolation, the exosomes were diluted in 100 µL of filtered PBS and stored at − 80 °C.

J Nanobiotechnol. 2020;18(1):171.","Expression profiling in exosomal miRNAs of diabetes, diabetes with coronary microcirculation disorder, and diabetes with coronary artery disease (human)","Due to the insidious onset and the difficulty to diagnose and intervene, it is particularly important to find the diagnostic markers of diabetic coronary microcirculation disorder (CMD) and therapeutic targets. Circulating exosomes, as endogenous exosomes derived from multiple tissue cells, mediate communication between cells and tissues, may serve as a key point for future diagnosis, prognosis and personalized treatment of CMD in diabetes. Therefore, we isolated serum exosomes from patients with diabetes, as well as patients with CMD or coronary artery disease (CAD) respectively. We explored the differences in characteristics between three circulating exosomes.
Overall design: Serum samples were obtained from 3 diabetes patients, 3 diabetes with CMD, and 3 diabetes with CAD. The serum-derived exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Exosomal miRNA profiling was sequencing on Illumina HiSeq X Ten."
