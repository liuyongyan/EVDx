",MOLECULAR PROFILING OF DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS BY A NOVEL microRNA SIGNATURE (human),"Objectives
Non-invasive staging of decompensated cirrhosis is an unmeet clinical need. The aims of this study were to characterize and validate a novel miRNA signature to stage decompensated cirrhosis and predict the portal pressure and cardiac dysfunction response to non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB).
Design
Serum samples from patients with decompensated cirrhosis (n=36) and healthy controls (n=36) were tested for a novel signature of five miRNAs (miR-452-5p, miR-429, miR-885-5p, miR-181b-5p, and miR-122-5p) identified in the secretome of primary human hepatocytes, and three miRNAs (miR-192-5p, miR-34a-5p and miR-29a-5p) previously discovered as biomarkers of chronic liver disease. All patients had ascites, that was refractory in 18 (50%), and were placed on NSBB for variceal bleeding prophylaxis. In all patients, serum miRNAs, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), and echocardiogram study was performed before and 1 month after NSBB.
Results
Cirrhotic patients had lower serum levels of miR-429, miR-885-5p, miR-181b-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p and miR-29a-5p (p<0.05). miR-452-5p and miR-429 expression were lower in NSBB responders  (p=0.006). miR-181b-5p expression was greater in refractory- than in diuretic sensitive ascites (p=0.008) and correlated with serum creatinine. miR-452-5p and miR-885-5p were inversely correlated with baseline systemic vascular resistance (ρ=-0.46 p=0.007; and ρ=-0.41 p=0.01 respectively), and with diminished systolic contractility in patients with refractory ascites after NSBB (ρ=-0.55 p=0.02; and ρ=-0.55 p=0.02, respectively).
Conclusion
Analysis of a miRNA signature in serum distinguishes patients with decompensated cirrhosis who show more severe systemic circulatory dysfunction and compromised systolic function after beta-blockade, and those more likely to benefit from NSBB.
