The study aimed to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in follicular fluid exosomes from women with DOR compared to normal ovarian reserve (NOR) and investigate their role in the proliferation and apoptosis of the human ovarian granulosa tumor cell line KGN.
Overall design: Follicular fluid exosomal miRNAs from women with DOR and NOR. All the participants were recruited from patients seeking fertility treatment at the Reproductive Medical Center of Peking University People’s Hospital between June 2020 and December 2020."
