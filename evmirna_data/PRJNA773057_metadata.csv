PRJNA773057,SRR16501715,sEV,Blood,Healthy donor,-,2022-01-02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35132877/,"Vesicles were also isolated from PBMCs and opsonized C. albicans-infected PBMCs using size exclusion chromatography with Sepharose CL-2B (Sigma-Aldrich) according to Böing et al. (64). In total, 15 1-mL fractions were collected from chromatography and subjected to vesicle detection. EVs were used immediately or stored at –20°C. For subsequent use, frozen EVs were thawed slowly on ice.",RNA sequencing of early extracellular vesicles derived from human monocytes in presence of C. albicans (human),"75 high abudance human miRNA were found to be transported by extracellular vesicles from human monocytes in presence of C. albicans
Overall design: Blood derived monocytes were incubated with C. albcians for 1 h, followed by isolation of extracellular vesicle and the cargo RNA. RNA from 8 donors were combined and sequenced"
