PRJNA637171,SRR11993929,sEV,Cell line|Cell line/NCC-RbC-51|Eye,Retinoblastoma,-,2021-03-31,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32795526/,The cells were grown to 90% confluence and the medium was replaced with Serum free media (1x Insulin Transferrin Selenium supplemented) and the culture was continued for 48h. Conditioned Media (CM) (approximately 150 ml) was harvested at the end of 48 h and centrifuged at 3000rpmto remove debris and filtered through 0.2 μm filter. Conditioned media was concentrated approximately 200 times using a Centricon Plus-70 centrifugal filter device (Cat: UFC701008) with a 10K nominal molecular weight limit. Concentrated CM (approximately 4 ml) was diluted for up to 10 ml and 2 ml of Exoquick TC reagent (Cat:EXOTC50A-1) was added and kept overnight at 4 °C. It was centrifuged at 5000rpmfor 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet containing the exosomes was resuspended with resuspension buffer (Invitrogen Cat:4478562). Exosomes were isolated from the serum samples using ExoQuick exosome precipitation solution (Cat: EXOQ20A-1).,Homo sapiens (human),Exosomal miRNA profiles of two RB cell lines WERI-Rb-1 and NCC-RbC-51 and a muller glial cell line MIO-M1 were generated by small RNA sequencing. The exosomal miRNA profiles of the three cell lines were compared to obtain RB specific miRNAs and exclusive miRNAs from the three cell lines
