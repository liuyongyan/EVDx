To characterize miRNAs related to colon cancer progression and metastasis, we first isolated and purified exosomes from SW480 and SW620 cell lines following the protocols. Exosomal size and marker were identified by EM and Western Blotting analysis. Then, total RNA was extracted for small RNA deep sequencing."
