First, 1 ml of follicular fluid was centrifuged at 700 x g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet any dead cells or cell debris; the pellet was discarded. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 2000 x g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet apoptotic bodies (ABs); the AB pellet was discarded. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 16500 x g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet microparticles (MPs); the MP pellet was resuspended in 200 ul PBS and snap frozen at -80°C for future use. The resulting supernatant was filtered using 0.2 um Whatman GD/X filters (Millipore Sigma, ON, Canada) and the appropriate volume of ExoQuick (System Biosciences, CA, USA) was added to the cleared supernatant and incubated overnight at 4°C without mixing. Following incubation, exosomes (EX) were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 30 min at 4°C; the EX pellet was resuspended in 200 ul PBS and snap frozen at -80°C for future use. The resulting supernatant, deemed follicular fluid depleted of EVs (FFD), was collected and snap-frozen at -80°C for future use.

Proper signaling between these compartments is required for optimal folliculogenesis. The association between polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and extracellular vesicular smallRNAs (snRNAs) signatures in follicular fluid (FF) and how this relates to adiposity is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether FF extracellular vesicle (FFEV)-derived snRNAs are differentially expressed (DE) between PCOS and non-PCOS subjects; and if these differences are vesicle-specific and/or adiposity-dependent. FF and granulosa cells (GC) were collected from 35 patients matched by demographic and stimulation parameters. FFEVs were isolated and snRNA libraries were constructed, sequenced, and analyzed. miRNAs were the most abundant biotype present, with specific enrichment in exosomes (EX), whereas in GCs long non-coding RNAs were the most abundant biotype. In obese PCOS vs. lean PCOS, pathway analysis revealed target genes involved in cell survival and apoptosis, leukocyte differentiation and migration, JAK/STAT, and MAPK signaling. In obese PCOS FFEVs were selectively enriched (FFEVs vs. GCs) for miRNAs targeting p53 signaling, cell survival and apoptosis, FOXO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK signaling. We provide comprehensive profiling of snRNAs in FFEVs and GCs of PCOS and non-PCOS patients, highlighting the effect of adiposity on these findings. We hypothesize that the selective packaging and release of miRNAs specifically targeting anti-apoptotic genes into the FF may be an attempt by the follicle to reduce the apoptotic pressure of the GCs and stave off premature apoptosis of the follicle observed in PCOS."

J Extracell Vesicles (2013) 2. doi: 10.3402/jev.v2i0.20709",Obesity and PCOS radically alters the snRNA composition of follicular fluid extracellular vesicles,"The ovarian follicle consists of the oocyte, somatic cells, and follicular fluid (FF). Proper signaling between these compartments is required for optimal folliculogenesis. The association between polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and extracellular vesicular smallRNAs (snRNAs) signatures in follicular fluid (FF) and how this relates to adiposity is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether FF extracellular vesicle (FFEV)-derived snRNAs are differentially expressed (DE) between PCOS and non-PCOS subjects; and if these differences are vesicle-specific and/or adiposity-dependent. FF and granulosa cells (GC) were collected from 35 patients matched by demographic and stimulation parameters. FFEVs were isolated and snRNA libraries were constructed, sequenced, and analyzed. miRNAs were the most abundant biotype present, with specific enrichment in exosomes (EX), whereas in GCs long non-coding RNAs were the most abundant biotype. In obese PCOS vs. lean PCOS, pathway analysis revealed target genes involved in cell survival and apoptosis, leukocyte differentiation and migration, JAK/STAT, and MAPK signaling. In obese PCOS FFEVs were selectively enriched (FFEVs vs. GCs) for miRNAs targeting p53 signaling, cell survival and apoptosis, FOXO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK signaling. We provide comprehensive profiling of snRNAs in FFEVs and GCs of PCOS and non-PCOS patients, highlighting the effect of adiposity on these findings. We hypothesize that the selective packaging and release of miRNAs specifically targeting anti-apoptotic genes into the FF may be an attempt by the follicle to reduce the apoptotic pressure of the GCs and stave off premature apoptosis of the follicle observed in PCOS."

First, 1 ml of follicular fluid was centrifuged at 700 x g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet any dead cells or cell debris; the pellet was discarded. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged again at 2000 x g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet apoptotic bodies (ABs); the AB pellet was discarded. The supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 16500 x g for 20 min at 4°C to pellet microparticles (MPs); the MP pellet was resuspended in 200 ul PBS and snap frozen at -80°C for future use. The resulting supernatant was filtered using 0.2 um Whatman GD/X filters (Millipore Sigma, ON, Canada) and the appropriate volume of ExoQuick (System Biosciences, CA, USA) was added to the cleared supernatant and incubated overnight at 4°C without mixing. Following incubation, exosomes (EX) were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 x g for 30 min at 4°C; the EX pellet was resuspended in 200 ul PBS and snap frozen at -80°C for future use. The resulting supernatant, deemed follicular fluid depleted of EVs (FFD), was collected and snap-frozen at -80°C for future use.
