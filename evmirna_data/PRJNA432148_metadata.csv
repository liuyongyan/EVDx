The latter was depleted of bovine exosomes by passage through a 0.22-µm PVDF filter (Millipore) and ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g for 90 minutes. Supernatant fractions collected were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 minutes at 4ºC to eliminate cells. Exosomes were isolated from culture medium with ExoQuick™ TC Kit (System Bioscience) in line with the manufacturer’s instructions.",Differential distribution and enrichment of non-coding RNAs in exosomes from Normal and Cancer Fibroblasts in colorectal cancer,Study of the differential distribution and enrichment of non-coding RNAs in exosomes from normal and cancer associated Fibroblasts in colorectal cancer
