Next, exosomes were isolated from the plasma at 4 °C. ",Homo sapiens (human),"Exosomes were extracted from the plasma of lung cancer with/without brain metastasis, and characterized by NTA, TEM and western blot. These exosomes were subject to small RNA sequencing to charactize the differential miRNAs"
