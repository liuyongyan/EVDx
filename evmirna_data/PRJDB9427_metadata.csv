Then, the conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min to deplete floating cells and at 10,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell debris. The plasma sample was mixed with thrombin (500 U/mL) for 10 min to remove fibrin, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. For exosome isolation, the supernatant, plasma, and serum were ultracentrifuged at an average of 110,000 × g for 2 h, followed by a washing step of the exosome pellet with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline with calcium and magnesium [PBS (+)] at an average of 110,000 × g for 2 h (TLA100.1 rotor, Beckman Coulter). ",Homo sapiens (human),We performed miRNA sequencing and compared the miRNAs profile of hMSCs-produced exosomes in the presence or absence of 20 ug/mL adiponectine in vitro. hMSCs-derived exosomes that were collected from the conditioned medium after 48 hours of cultures.
