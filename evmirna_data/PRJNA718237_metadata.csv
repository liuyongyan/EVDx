All patients and volunteers fasted for 8 h and abandoned the first tube after early morning blood draw. Then, 10 mL of whole blood was collected using an EDTA anticoagulant tube and centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 15 min for the removal of blood cells and fragments. Plasma exosomes were extracted with exoEasy Maxi kit (QIAGEN, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, 200 μL of exosomes were obtained and stored separately at −80 °C. A transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, H-7650) was used in evaluating morphology at an acceleration voltage of 80 kV.

Standardization of sample collection, isolation and analysis methods in extracellular vesicle research (2013)",Plasma exosome microRNA sequencing of Legg-Cavé-Perthes disease (human),"We performed the miRNA-seq analysis of 3 plasma exosomes from Legg-Cavé-Perthes patients and 3 plasma exosomes from healthy volunteers based on the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform and obtained data of 6 samples.
Overall design: Plasma exosomal miRNA profiles of 3 Legg-Cavé-Perthes patients and 3 healthy volunteers."
