Exosomes are known to be secreted from all types of cells, and the exosomes-released molecules are crucial messengers that can regulate cellular processes. We investigated the miRNAs content of exosomes released by cancer cells during the invasion process. An invasion stimulus has been generated through scratches created on the confluent cells of cancer cell lines: glioblastoma, breast and prostate cancers."
