The DC isolation procedure was performed according to our previous report (Min et al., 2019b). Briefly, the plasma was centrifugated at 3000×g for 15 min and 13,000×g for 30 min, to remove cell debris and large EVs respectively, and the final supernatant was 1:7 diluted by PBS, filtered by a 0.22 μm sieve, ultracentrifuged using a P50AT2-986 -rotor (CP100NX; Hitachi, Brea, CA) at 150,000×g, 4 °C for 4 h to collect the sEVs. The pellet was washing in PBS and centrifuged again at 150,000×g, 4 °C for 2 h. Then the sEVs enriched fraction was re-suspended in 100 µL PBS.

The DC isolation procedure was performed according to our previous report (Min et al., 2019b). Briefly, the plasma was centrifugated at 3000×g for 15 min and 13,000×g for 30 min, to remove cell debris and large EVs respectively, and the final supernatant was 1:7 diluted by PBS, filtered by a 0.22 μm sieve, ultracentrifuged using a P50AT2-986 -rotor (CP100NX; Hitachi, Brea, CA) at 150,000×g, 4 °C for 4 h to collect the sEVs. The pellet was washing in PBS and centrifuged again at 150,000×g, 4 °C for 2 h. Then the sEVs enriched fraction was re-suspended in 100 µL PBS.
