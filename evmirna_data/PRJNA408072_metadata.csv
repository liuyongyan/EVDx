Briefly, conditioned medium (CM) was spun at 300 g for 5 minutes, followed by a spin at 1,500 g for 10 minutes and 0.22 µm filtration to remove dead cells, cell debris and larger particles. EV pelleting was performed by two consecutive pelleting steps at 110,000 g for 90 minutes, with an intermediate washing of the EV pellet in 25 ml of PBS. The final EV pellet was resuspended in PBS and either stored at −80 °C for proteomic analysis as indicated below or mixed with Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored at −80 °C until RNA extraction for small RNA sequencing analysis. All UC steps were performed at 4 °C, using a fixed angle Type 70 Ti rotor from Beckman Coulter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA).","Mus Musculus, Homo Sapiens",small RNA sequencing of extracellular vesicles and their parental cells
