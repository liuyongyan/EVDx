Diafiltration was then performed to remove the contaminants in the media through the circulation of PBS under a controlled flow rate (35 mL min−1). After TFF purification, the media was collected and further condensed to ≈5 mL by using an Amicon ultra-centrifugal unit (Merck Millipore) with at 3000×g for 20 min. Then, the concentrated media was loaded into size exclusion columns (qEV10/70 nm, Izon Science), followed by elution with PBS buffer. The final sEV fractions were collected following the manufacturer's protocols and further condensed by using an Amicon ultra-centrifugal unit at 3000×g for packaging and storage. All steps were performed at 4 °C.",Exosomal mRNAs for Angiogenic Osteogenic Coupled Bone Repair,Small RNA sequence for differential microRNAs expression in small extracellular vesicles engineered by our new technology (TM-nanoEP).
