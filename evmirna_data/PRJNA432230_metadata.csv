The medium was centrifuged at 500 g for five minutes and at 2000 g for thirty minutes at 4 °C to remove cellular debris and large apoptotic bodies. After centrifugation, media was added to an equal volume of a 2× polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW 6000, Sigma, 81,260) solution (final concentration, 8%). The samples were mixed thoroughly by inversion and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Before the tubes were tapped occasionally and drained for five minutes to remove excess PEG, the samples were further centrifuged at maximum speed (15,000 rpm) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were further purified using 5% PEG and then stored in 50–100 μl of particle-free PBS (pH 7.4) at − 80 °C. ",High-throughput sequencing  identify miRNAs involved in exosomes of MDA-MB-231 cocultivated with or without mature 3T3-L1 (human),"To identify miRNAs involved in exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cultivated with mature 3T3-L1, small RNA libraries from exosomes stored at 20 °C for 0 and 24 h were constructed. A total of 432 small RNA sequences were generated, and 88 known and 1224 new candidate miRNAs were obtained. Among them, 85 miRNAs were up-regulated and 300 were down-regulated in exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cultivated with mature 3T3-L1.
Overall design: exosomes from MDA-MB-231 cultivated with mature 3T3-L1"
