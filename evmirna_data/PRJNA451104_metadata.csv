PRJNA451104,SRR7046204,sEV,Breast|Cell line|Cell line/MDA-MB-231,Breast cancer,-,2021-04-19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA451104/,-,Next Generation Sequencing of exosomal microRNA derived from MCU downregulated and control MDA-MB-231 cells. (human),"To explore the role of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) in exosomal microRNA(miRNA) sorting in MDA-MB-231 cells, we isolated miRNA from the exosomes derived from MCU-downregulated and control MDA-MB-231 cells. We then performed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to find and validate differetial expressed exosomal miRNAs that regulated by MCU.
Overall design: Examination of differential expressed exosomal miRNAs in MCU-downregualted and control MDA-MB-231 cells."
