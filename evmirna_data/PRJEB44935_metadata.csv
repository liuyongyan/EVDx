Briefly, approximately 400 mg of first trimester placental explants (wet weight) were dissected and cultured in Netwell™ culture inserts (400 µm mesh), suspended in 12 well culture plates, at 37 °C in advanced DMEM/F12 containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in an ambient oxygen atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide for 24 h. The Netwell™ inserts (containing the explants) were then removed from the culture wells and the conditioned media aspirated for use. Cellular debris was removed from the conditioned media by centrifuging at 2000× g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 20,000× g for 1 h for placental large EV collection. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000× g for 1 h for placental small EV collection (Avanti J30I Ultracentrifuge, JA 30.50 fixed angle rotor, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).

Treating normal early gestation placentae with preeclamptic sera produces extracellular micro and nano vesicles that activate endothelial cells. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2017;120:34–41.",miRNA profile of extracellular vesicles from missed miscarriage,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), secreted by a variety of cells from different tissues, can carry abundant of cargos including nucleotides, protein and lipids to recipient cells. After phagocytized by recipient cells, the cargos in EVs can adjust the function of recipient cells. Missed miscarriage is one where the baby has died or not developed, but has not been physically miscarried, although studies showed that the villus EVs can influence the pathogenesis of missed miscarriage, the cargos of the EVs from the missed misscarriage has not been fully understood. Micro RNA (miRNA), considered as a group of small RNAs which can adjust the expression of mRNA, are a major group of cargos carried by EVs. This study mainly showed the miRNA profile in EVs from missed miscarriage by miRNA high through-put sequencing, therefore illustrate the adjust function of EVs from missed miscarriage villus on the process of missed miscarriage."
