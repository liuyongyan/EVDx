PRJNA891637,SRR21944900,sEV,Blood,-,Lamin A/C (LMNA) p.R527C mutation-passage 13 (late stage of senescence),2022-10-18,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37427980/,"The cultured medium was concentrated to a volume of 500 μL using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filtration device (100 kDa; Merck Millipore). The excretion column (Izon Science, New Zealand) was used according to the protocol. The column was equilibrated at room temperature and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before adding 500 μL of the sample. Immediately after adding the sample to the column, 500 μL of the fraction was collected. The morphology of EVs was detected by TEM, the size distribution of EVs was captured by NTA and EV markers were detected using western blot.",Multi-omic analysis of serial-cultured human iPSC-derived MSC with lamin A/C mutation reveals miR-311 as a potential biomarker of senescent cells,"Pathogenic mutations in lamin A/C (LMNA) lead to nuclear structural abnormalities, mesenchymal tissue damage, and laminopathies, which have numerous tissue-specific and progeria phenotypes. However, how LMNA mutations lead to accelerated mesenchymal-derived cell senescence remains unclear. Here, we found that the effects of young MSC-EV and senescent MSCP-EV on LMNA R527C iMSC senescence were inconsistent. To find out the essential elements during exosome treatment, we performed miRNA sequencing of exosomes derived from LMNA R527C MSCs, and identified MSC-EVs could promote surrounding cell senescence via carrying high levels of pro-senescence miRNAs, among which the novel miRNA (called miR-311) could be used as a new indicator to detect chronic and acute MSC senescence and play a role in promoting senescence."
