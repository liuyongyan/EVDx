Briefly, 3.5 × 106 N2a cells were culture in 10 cm dish. 24 h before collecting supernatants, the culture medium was replaced with FBS free medium containing DMEM (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (ThermoFisher) only. After conditioned media collection, exosomes were isolated by sequential centrifugation: conditioned media was first centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min to eliminate flowing cells, at 3,000 g for 20 min to eliminate cellular debris, at 10,000 g for 30 min to eliminate intracellular organelles and then at 100,000 g for 2 h to precipitate exosomes. All steps of centrifugation were handled at 4°C. For brain exosome isolation, fresh mouse brains were dissected and treated with 20 units/ml papain (Worthington) in Hibernate E solution (5 ml/brain) for 30 min at 37°C. The brain tissue was gently homogenized in 10 ml cold Hibernate E solution. The brain homogenate was sequentially filtered through a 40 μm mesh filter (BD Biosciences) and a 0.2 μm syringe filter (Thermo Scientific). Exosomes in the filtrate were collected through gradient centrifugation as described above. Exosomes in the serum were isolated using ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation kit (System Biosciences). Exosomes were resuspended in PBS and stored in −80°C until required.",miRNA sequencing of exosomes derived from N2A and APP-N2A cells,"APP misexpression plays a crucial role in triggering a complex pathological cascade, leading to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aim of this study is for determine the influence of APP ectopic expression on the miRNA profiles of neuronal exosomes. In study, miRNA sequencing was done using the exosomes derived from N2A (control) and APP-N2A (N2A with APP overexpression)."
