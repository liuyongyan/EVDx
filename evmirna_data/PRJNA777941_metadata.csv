Here, we identify endoplasmic reticulum membrane contact sites (ER MCS) as platforms for generation of RNA-containing EVs. We identify a subpopulation of small EVs that is highly enriched in RNA and regulated by the ER MCS linker protein VAP-A. Functionally, VAP-A-regulated EVs are critical for miR-100 transfer between cells and in vivo tumor formation. Lipid analysis of VAP-A-knockdown EVs revealed reductions in the EV biogenesis lipid ceramide. Knockdown of the VAP-A-binding ceramide transfer protein CERT led to similar defects in EV RNA content. Imaging experiments revealed that VAP-A promotes lumenal filling of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). CERT localizes to MVBs, and the ceramide-generating enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 colocalizes with VAP-A-positive ER. We propose that ceramide transfer via VAP-A-CERT linkages drives biogenesis of a select RNA-containing population.

Here, we identify endoplasmic reticulum membrane contact sites (ER MCS) as platforms for generation of RNA-containing EVs. We identify a subpopulation of small EVs that is highly enriched in RNA and regulated by the ER MCS linker protein VAP-A. Functionally, VAP-A-regulated EVs are critical for miR-100 transfer between cells and in vivo tumor formation. Lipid analysis of VAP-A-knockdown EVs revealed reductions in the EV biogenesis lipid ceramide. Knockdown of the VAP-A-binding ceramide transfer protein CERT led to similar defects in EV RNA content. Imaging experiments revealed that VAP-A promotes lumenal filling of multivesicular bodies (MVBs). CERT localizes to MVBs, and the ceramide-generating enzyme neutral sphingomyelinase 2 colocalizes with VAP-A-positive ER. We propose that ceramide transfer via VAP-A-CERT linkages drives biogenesis of a select RNA-containing population.
