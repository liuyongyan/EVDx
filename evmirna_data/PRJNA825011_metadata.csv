Briefly, the obtained plasma was centrifuged at 12000 g for 30 min to wipe off the cell fragments. The supernatant was filtered with a 0.22μm sterile filter to eliminate large particle vesicles above 220 nm. After centrifuged at 120000 g for 60 min, followed by 120000 g for 60 min. The sediments were resuspended with 200 μL pre-cooled PBS, which was exosomes.
