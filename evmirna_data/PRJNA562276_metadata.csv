The supernatant was taken as plasma and stored at −80°C for future use. Two hundred microliter of plasma from each case was used. Prior to exosome precipitation, plasma samples were treated with RNase A to remove free circulating RNAs and then RNase A was inactivated with RNase inhibitor. Exosomes were isolated using the Total Exosome Isolation Kit (from plasma) (Invitrogen™) following manufacturer's instructions. For the validation cohort at Mayo Clinic, US, exosomes were isolated using ExoQuick Plasma prep and Exosome precipitation kit (System Biosciences) without RNase pre-treatment.",The identification of plasma exosomal miR-423-3p as a potential predictive biomarker for prostate cancer castration-resistance development by plasma exosomal miRNA sequencing (human),"Exosomal miRNAs play important roles in cancer progression and therapeutic resistance and have shown great potential as liquid biopsy biomarkers for cancer diagnosis/prognosis. We investigated for the first time plasma exosomal miRNAs for their association with and early detection potential of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
RNA-sequencing was performed to identify candidate exosomal miRNAs associated with development of CRPC in 24 treatment-naive prostate cancer (PCa) and 24 CRPC patients.
Overall design: Examine differentially expressed plasma exosomal miRNAs between 24 treatment-naïve prostate cancer patients and 24 castration-resistant prostate cancer patients."
