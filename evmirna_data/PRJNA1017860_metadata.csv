The conditioned media on each alternative day were collected 3–4 times until the cells reached about 90% confluency and subjected to successive centrifugation steps at 300× g for 10 min to eliminate cell debris and macro particles. Then, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000× g for an additional 20 min. The resulting cell-free medium was ultra-centrifuged at 100,000× g for 1 h, and the collected exosome pellet was re-suspended in 1× PBS and ultra-centrifuged at 100,000× g for another hour. Finally, the Exo pellet was re-suspended in 1× PBS and pooled from the same flask and stored at −80 °C until further analysis.",MicroRNA and protein cargos of human limbal epithelial cell-derived exosomes and their regulatory roles in limbal stromal cells of diabetic and non-diabetic cornea (human),"Epithelial and stromal/mesenchymal limbal stem cells contribute to corneal homeostasis and cell renewal. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes (Exos), can be paracrine mediators of intercellular communication. Previously, we described cargos and regulatory roles of limbal stromal cell (LSC)-derived Exos in non-diabetic (N) and diabetic (DM) limbal epithelial cells (LEC). Presently, we quantify the miRNA and proteome profiles of human LEC-derived Exos and their regulatory roles in N- and DM-LSC. We revealed some miRNA and protein differences in DM vs. N-LEC-derived Exos' cargos including proteins involved in Exo biogenesis and packaging that may affect Exo production and ultimately cellular crosstalk and corneal function. Treatment by N-Exos, but not by DM-Exos enhanced wound healing in cultured N-LSC and increased proliferation rate in N and DM LSCs vs. corresponding untreated (control) cells. N-Exos treated LSC reduced keratocyte markers ALDH3A1 and lumican, and increased MSC markers CD73, CD90 and CD105 vs. control LSC. These being opposite to the changes quantified in wounded LSCs. Overall, N-LEC Exos have a more pronounced effect on LSC wound healing, proliferation, and stem cell marker expression than DM-LEC Exos. This suggests that regulatory miRNA and protein cargo differences in DM- vs. N-LEC-derived Exos could contribute to the disease state.
