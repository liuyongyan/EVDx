MiRNA sequencing was performed to assess differential expression using next-generation sequencing. The data showed that most miRNAs levels were different in plasma exosomal. Importantly, miR-92b-3p were much higher in the post-chemoresistant stage than in the pre-chemoresistant stage
Overall design: MiRNA sequencing was performed to assess differential expression of miRNAs in  plasma exosomes of two small cell lung cancer patients at the pre- and post-chemoresistant stages using next-generation sequencing."
