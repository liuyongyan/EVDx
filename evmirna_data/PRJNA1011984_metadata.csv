ExoRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate EV-RNAs, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After thawing, 500 μL of each serum sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to sediment larger particles. Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles were separated, using a membrane-based system, from 450 μL of centrifuged sera. Purified vesicles were analyzed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, which showed round-shaped structures ranging from 50 to 250 nm in diameter. The majority of the vesicles had the size of exosomes, i.e., 30–100 nm62 (data not shown).",Global blood miRNA profiling unravels early signatures of immunogenicity of Ebola vaccine rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (human),"We characterized the extracellular miRNAs, isolated from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), induced by vaccination against Ebola.
We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.

ExoRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate EV-RNAs, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After thawing, 500 μL of each serum sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to sediment larger particles. Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles were separated, using a membrane-based system, from 450 μL of centrifuged sera. Purified vesicles were analyzed by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy, which showed round-shaped structures ranging from 50 to 250 nm in diameter. The majority of the vesicles had the size of exosomes, i.e., 30–100 nm62 (data not shown).",Global blood miRNA profiling unravels early signatures of immunogenicity of Ebola vaccine rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP (human),"We characterized the extracellular miRNAs, isolated from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV), induced by vaccination against Ebola.
We identified early miRNA signatures associated with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody responses at day 28 or 360 post-vaccination.
Overall design: We isolated total RNA including miRNA from serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EV) from 48 healthy individuals receiving the rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine or placebo. Timepoints day 0 (baseline before vaccination), and days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 post-vaccination have been considered. We performed miRNA-seq. We then identified differentially expressed miRNAs by comparing rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccines vs placebo controls. Next, we correlated baseline and early miRNAs with the ZEBOV-specific IgG antibody titer measured at day 28 and day 360 by performing Pearson Correlation. We used Machine Learning algorithms to identify the best early miRNA signatures able to discriminate high and low antibody levels at day 28 and day 360. Finally, we identified a miRNA antibody predictive signature associated with immune-related target mRNAs and corresponding pathways.
