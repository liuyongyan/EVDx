Overall design: Amniotic fluid samples were collected during cesarean delivery from women who provided written informed consent from January 2012 to October 2017 at Nagoya University Hospital. Twenty-one CDH cases born at late and full term (between 37 0/7 and 41 6/7 gestational weeks) and those who born at late and full term at the same time without congenital malformations or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (control cases: n = 24) were included. CDH cases were divided into two groups; the good prognosis group (CDH-Good) and the poor prognosis group (CDH-Poor). Cases who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and neonatal deaths were defined as the CDH-Poor group (n = 5), and the others were defined as the CDH-Good group (n = 16)."

To investigate the pathogenesis of CDH, miRNA sequencing was performed using amniotic fluid-derived extracellular vesicles (AF-EVs) of CDH patients.
Overall design: Amniotic fluid samples were collected during cesarean delivery from women who provided written informed consent from January 2012 to October 2017 at Nagoya University Hospital. Twenty-one CDH cases born at late and full term (between 37 0/7 and 41 6/7 gestational weeks) and those who born at late and full term at the same time without congenital malformations or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (control cases: n = 24) were included. CDH cases were divided into two groups; the good prognosis group (CDH-Good) and the poor prognosis group (CDH-Poor). Cases who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and neonatal deaths were defined as the CDH-Poor group (n = 5), and the others were defined as the CDH-Good group (n = 16)."
