The cell supernatant was collected and centrifuged to remove cells and debris and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA). Then, 0.5 volumes of Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) was added followed by incubation at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and the precipitate was collected.",Analysis of exosomal miRNAs in MCF7 cells regulated by LSD1 (human),"Lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is an important histone demethylase that mediates metastasis in luminal breast cancer. Exosomes play a major role in cell-to-cell communication. Thus, the characterization of miRNAs of exosome in MCF7 cells regulated by LSD1 is imperative in clarifying intercellular signaling.
Overall design: miRNA-seq in exosomes isolated from scrambled control siRNAs transfected MCF7 cells (NC), LSD1-specific siRNAs transfected MCF7 (KD), MCF7 cells transfected with LSD1-specific siRNAs and LSD1 rescue plasmid (RE). Each cell type have 3 biological replicates."
