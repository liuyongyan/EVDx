Subsequently, large extracellular vesicles were discarded at 20 000 g for 30 min, and exosomes were extracted at 100 000 g for 120 min and then filtered through a 0.22 µm filter. Furthermore, to dispose of impure residual proteins, the exosome pellet was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the ultracentrifugation (100 000×g, 120 min) was repeated, after which exosomes were resuspended in PBS solution (200 µL) and stored at −80  °C. All procedures were conducted under 4 °C.",3D-hUMSCs exosomes enriched with miR-125b-5p and miR-132-3p ameliorate vitiligo by simultaneously suppressing oxidative stress-induced melanocyte damage and potentiating Treg cells-mediated immunosuppression (human),"As a crucial component of exosome cargo, miRNAs have been reported to be deeply involved in regulating intercellular communication and multiple biological functions. Based on the results above, we performed high-throughput miRNA sequencing of 2D-Exo and 3D-Exo to identify the potential miRNAs.
Overall design: Exosomes extracted from 2D and 3D cultured human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells supernatants were sequenced"
