In brief, plasma was diluted with an equal volume of PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 2000×g for 30 min at 4 °C (Sorvall®, high speed microcentrifuge, fixed rotor angle: 90°, Thermo Fisher Scientific Ins., Asheville, NC, USA,). The 2000×g supernatant fluid was then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 45 min at 4 °C (Sorvall, high speed microcentrifuge, fixed rotor angle: 90°). The resultant supernatant fluid (2 mL) was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman, 10 ml) and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 2 h (Sorvall, T-8100, fixed angle ultracentrifuge rotor). The pellet was resuspended in PBS (10 mL) and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Steritop™, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then centrifuged at 100,000×g for 2 h. The 100,000 g pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and layered on top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient containing 40% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v) and 5% (w/v) iodixanol (solutions were made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60% (w/v) aqueous iodixanol from Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 20 h. Fractions were collected manually from top to bottom (with increasing density), diluted with PBS and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, the pellet containing the enriched sEVs population was resuspended in 50 μL PBS. ",Circulating exosomal miRNA signature in pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus across gestation (human),"The aim of this study was to establish the exosomal miRNA profile across gestation in normal and GDM pregnancies and to determine the signaling pathways associated with the changes in the miRNA profile in GDM.
Overall design: miRNAs were profiled from exosomes using next generation seqeuencing (Illumina NextSeq 500 platform)."

The resultant supernatant fluid (2 mL) was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman, 10 ml) and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 2 h (Sorvall, T-8100, fixed angle ultracentrifuge rotor). The pellet was resuspended in PBS (10 mL) and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Steritop™, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then centrifuged at 100,000×g for 2 h. The 100,000 g pellet was resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and layered on top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient containing 40% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v) and 5% (w/v) iodixanol (solutions were made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60% (w/v) aqueous iodixanol from Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 20 h. Fractions were collected manually from top to bottom (with increasing density), diluted with PBS and centrifuged at 100,000×g for 2 h at 4 °C. Finally, the pellet containing the enriched sEVs population was resuspended in 50 μL PBS. ",Circulating exosomal miRNA signature in pregnancies with gestational diabetes mellitus across gestation (human),"The aim of this study was to establish the exosomal miRNA profile across gestation in normal and GDM pregnancies and to determine the signaling pathways associated with the changes in the miRNA profile in GDM.
Overall design: miRNAs were profiled from exosomes using next generation seqeuencing (Illumina NextSeq 500 platform)."
PRJNA472881,GSM3151972,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Healthy donor,-,2021-05-24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34416903/,"EVs were isolated from plasma (1 mL) as previously described [5]. In brief, plasma was diluted with an equal volume of PBS (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 2000×g for 30 min at 4 °C (Sorvall®, high speed microcentrifuge, fixed rotor angle: 90°, Thermo Fisher Scientific Ins., Asheville, NC, USA,). The 2000×g supernatant fluid was then centrifuged at 12,000×g for 45 min at 4 °C (Sorvall, high speed microcentrifuge, fixed rotor angle: 90°).
