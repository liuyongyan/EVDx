Exosomes were isolated from the conditioned medium by differential centrifugation. In brief, conditioned medium was centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min and then at 2,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cells, followed by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter to remove cell debris. Exosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 90 min. They were resuspended in PBS and collected by ultracentrifugation again at 100,000 g for 90 min. The size and concentration of the exosomes were quantified by qNano (Izon Science, New Zealand) and exosomes were ready for RNA/protein extraction or cell treatment.",Homo sapiens (human),"We used next-generation sequencing to identify differential microRNA (miRNA) signatures in exosomes isolated from ovarian cancer cells and ovarian cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and adipocytes (CAAs). We found that a significantly higher levels of miR21 isomiRNAs in exosomes isolated from CAFs and CAAs than in those from ovarian cancer cells.
Overall design: Samples are exosomes isolated from four ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780, HeyA8, OVCA433 and SKOV3), two normal fibroblasts, three CAFs, two normal adipocytes and two CAAs"
