Since the malaria parasite may alter the host's miRNA expression, miRNA expression study was carried out during the in vitro erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 in order to detect the involvement of miRNAs during the malaria molecular complexity. Exosomal short RNAs and microRNAs from control and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes were sequenced using the Illumina NOVASEQ platform. miRNAs were expressed differently in erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum compared to control erythrocytes and in exosomes made from the two types of erythrocytes. In addition the differential miRNA study was performed between Control erythrocytes with malaria history and without malaria history."
