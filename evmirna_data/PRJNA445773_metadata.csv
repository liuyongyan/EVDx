The conditioned media were collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate dead cells, followed by filtration of the supernatant through a 0.2 μm filter unit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to eliminate cell debris. The filtrates were stored at 4 °C until ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 160 min at 4 °C (SRP28SA1, Hitachi Koki, Tokyo, Japan). The exosome pellets were washed once by resuspending them in PBS and ultracentrifugation. The pellets were again resuspended in 50 μL of PBS, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use.

April;Chapter 3:Unit 3 22.",Homo sapiens isolate:MH7A (human),"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease causing chronic inflammation in joints. A central part of the RA pathogenesis is carried out by intercellular communication containing synovial fibroblasts. Here, we tried to identify primarily exosomal miRNAs derived from synovial fibroblasts in order to better understand the intercellular communication involving to the RA pathogenesis. Exosomes were collected from a RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) cell line, MH7A, with or without stimulation by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We used small RNA-Seq to analyze the profile of small RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) in MH7A exosomes and cells. With differential expression analysis, we identified that four miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-323a-5p, and miR-1307-3p) were upregulated in exosomes with TNF-α stimulation. Identification of miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p which have been reported to involve in RA patients suggested the validity of our experimental model. miR-323a-5p was predicted to target CD6 which attenuated T cell activation signals, and miR-1307-3p was predicted to target N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 protein (NDRG2) which inhibited expression of osteoclast-related genes. Accordingly, it suggested these miRNAs might involve to the RA pathogenesis. Our results will assist in understanding the function of RASF exosomes in RA pathogenesis."

April;Chapter 3:Unit 3 22.",Homo sapiens isolate:MH7A (human),"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease causing chronic inflammation in joints. A central part of the RA pathogenesis is carried out by intercellular communication containing synovial fibroblasts. Here, we tried to identify primarily exosomal miRNAs derived from synovial fibroblasts in order to better understand the intercellular communication involving to the RA pathogenesis. Exosomes were collected from a RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) cell line, MH7A, with or without stimulation by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). We used small RNA-Seq to analyze the profile of small RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) in MH7A exosomes and cells. With differential expression analysis, we identified that four miRNAs (miR-155-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-323a-5p, and miR-1307-3p) were upregulated in exosomes with TNF-α stimulation. Identification of miR-155-5p and miR-146a-5p which have been reported to involve in RA patients suggested the validity of our experimental model. miR-323a-5p was predicted to target CD6 which attenuated T cell activation signals, and miR-1307-3p was predicted to target N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 protein (NDRG2) which inhibited expression of osteoclast-related genes. Accordingly, it suggested these miRNAs might involve to the RA pathogenesis. Our results will assist in understanding the function of RASF exosomes in RA pathogenesis."

The conditioned media were collected and centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate dead cells, followed by filtration of the supernatant through a 0.2 μm filter unit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to eliminate cell debris. The filtrates were stored at 4 °C until ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 160 min at 4 °C (SRP28SA1, Hitachi Koki, Tokyo, Japan). The exosome pellets were washed once by resuspending them in PBS and ultracentrifugation. The pellets were again resuspended in 50 μL of PBS, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until use.
