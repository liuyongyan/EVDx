HCC827 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium using exosome-free serum. After the supernatant was collected, centrifugation at 300g for 10 min at 4°C was used for the removal of non-adherent cells. The second centrifugation at 2,000g for 10 min at 4°C was followed by a third one at 10,000g for 30 min at 4°C, with the supernatant being transferred to a clean tube during each round. Finally, the exosomes were pelleted via ultracentrifugation at 120,000g for 70 min at 4°C. Subsequently, the exosome pellet was washed with 1× PBS and centrifuged at 120,000g for another 70 min, followed by resuspension in 1× PBS. The BCA protein assay kit (PC0020; Solarbio) was used to measure the exosome concentration. ",Tumour-derived exosomes regulate apoptosis of CD45+EpCAM+ cells in lung cancer (human),"Cancer-derived exosomes can deliver nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids to neighboring or distant cells and subsequently modulate recipient cells. Recently, high levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in cancer-derived exosomes, which provide a favorable microenvironment that contribute to tumorigenesis, tumor metastasis, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and immune escape. Howerer, the mechanism of the cancer-derived exosomes regulating CD45+EpCAM+ cell apoptosis remains unclear.
Overall design: Exosomes (1 samples per group) were collected from HCC827 cell culture supernatant on 48h. Then the total RNAs were extracted and subjected to miRNA sequencing."
