PRJNA282693,SRR2005874,lEV,Cell line|Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines,-,-,2015-12-18,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24480987/,-,Homo sapiens (human),"Microvesicles (MVs) are extracellular vesicles released by most cells and play critical roles in the progression and relapse of cancers. Our previous work demonstrated that MVs derived from K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines could transform mononuclear cells (MNCs) from normal hematopoietic transplants to acute leukemia-like cancer cells. During the transformation, a new group of leukemia-like cells could be observed after 14 days consecutive incubation with MVs and most of them were transformed to leukemia-like cells after 21 days. To study the gene expression change and the mechanism of the process of K562-MVs transforming MNCs, we performed RNA-seq and small RNA-seq for 5 samples of the key time points, which were samples of K562-MVs, MNCs, 1 week/2 weeks/3 weeks cells after MVs incubation. The K562 cell line was purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (Wuhan, China). MNCs were extracted from the peripheral blood mobilization provided by healthy volunteers. Sequencing of 5 samples were performed by WuXi AppTec Co Shanghai, China."
