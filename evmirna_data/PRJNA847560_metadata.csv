The supernatant was then filtered and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 x g for 2 h. The precipitate was collected and resuspended in PBS. After centrifugation at 100,000 x g for 70 min, exosomes were collected and stored at -80℃ until use.",MicroRNA-sequencing Analysis of Plasma-derived Exosomes Provides Novel Insights into the Disease Mechanism of Childhood Atopic Dermatitis (human),"To investigate the expression pattern of exosomal miRNAs in pediatric atopic dermatitis patients, we performed miRNA-Seq of plasmal exosome from 5 patients and 5 healthy controls. We identify 40 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs (DEPEMs) and found their target genes were involved in multiple functions and pathways associated with AD through  GO and KEGG pathway analysis.
Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of miRNA-seq data for pediatric atopic dermatitis patients and healthy controls."
