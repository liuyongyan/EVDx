T47D cells were cultivated for 36 h in RPMI 1640 without fetal bovine serum. The conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 300×g for 10 min and the resulting supernatant was further centrifuged at 2000×g for 10 min to remove apoptotic bodies and large cellular debris. The conditioned medium was then centrifuged again at 2000×g for 10 min. Supernatants were filtered through 0.22-μm filters (Millipore, MA, USA) and centrifuged again at 5000×g to concentrate exosomes. The total exosome isolation reagent (Invitrogen, NY, USA) was added to the supernatant in one-half volume and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,000×g for 1 h, and the separated exosomes were obtained from the precipitate.",LSD1 inhibits the invasion and migration of breast cancer through exosomes (human),"Metastasis accounts for almost 90% of breast cancer-related fatalities, making it frequent malignancy and the main reason of tumor mortality globally among women. A key player in breast cancer is the histone demethylase lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1). We used LSD1 knockdown MCF7 and T47D cell exosomes to treat breast cancer cells for greatly increasing the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells for evaluating the impact of LSD1 on breast cancer invasion and migration. miR-1290 expression was downregulated in LSD1 knockdown MCF7 exosomes. Furthermore, miR-1290 could control NAT1 expression by looking through the database of miR-1290 target genes. These data provide fresh insights into the biology of breast cancer therapy by demonstrating how the epigenetic factor LSD1 stimulates the breast cancer cells’ invasion and migration via controlling exosomal miRNA.
Overall design: To investigate the effect of exosomes on invasive migration of breast cancer cells after LSD1 Knockdown, we constructed LSD1 Knockdown and Rescue MCF7 cells by transient transfection and enriched their exosomes. We performed Small RNA gene expression profiling of exosomes from the constructed cells (Control, LSD1 KD, Rescue), respectively."
