SCAP were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in minimum essential medium Eagle (MEM, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% l-glutamine 200 mM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Non-activated and activated SCAP were cultured for 3 days in serum-free MEM and in serum-free MEM containing TNFα (20 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (20 ng/ml), respectively [16]. Conditioned media were then collected and EV were isolated by centrifugation and ultrafiltration followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1A). Briefly cells, dead cells and cell debris were removed by successive centrifugations (300 g for 10 min, 1000 g for 20 min and 10,000 g for 30 min, respectively). The supernatant was then filtrated on 0.22 μm filter and concentrated 200–400 times using an ultrafiltration device with a 30 kDa or a 100 kDa cut-off (Centricon® Plus-70, Merck Millipore, Burlington, USA) until a volume lower than 500 μl was obtained. Finally, small EV (exosomes and small microvesicles) were separated from contaminating proteins using a SEC column (qEV Original® 35 nm or 70 nm, Izon Science, Lyon, France). Fractions from 1 to 30 (500 μl each) were collected. Endotoxin detection and quantification were performed with ToxinSensor™ Chromogenic LAL Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions.",Impact of a pro-inflammatory stimulus on the miRNA composition of extracellular vesicles (EV) from stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP) (human),"To investigate the impact of a pro-inflammatory stimulus (TNFα and IFNγ, 20 ng/ml) on miRNA in SCAP-EV, we isolated EV from non-activated and activated SCAP  and then extracted miRNA
Overall design: Comparative miRNA expression between EV from non-activated SCAP and EV from activated SCAP (activation with TNFα and IFNγ). We replicated this experiment 3 times."
