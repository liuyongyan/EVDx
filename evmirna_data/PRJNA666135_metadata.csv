SAT-EVs and OAT-EVs were isolated from fresh human AT specimens. Samples were rinsed twice with PBS 1× to remove blood cells, mechanically minced into small pieces, and maintained in RPMI medium without serum or growth factors for 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. EVs were collected from supernatants. After being centrifuged at 3000g for 20 minutes and microfiltered over a 0.22 μm filter (MilliporeSigma) to remove debris, cell-free supernatants derived from cell cultures and human AT were ultracentrifuged at 100,000g using a SW70Yi rotor (Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K ultracentrifuge) for 2 hours at 4°C. EVs were either used fresh or stored at –80°C after resuspension in RPMI supplied with 1% DMSO (v/v). Frozen EVs were washed and pelleted under 100,000g ultracentrifugation to remove DMSO before experiments on cells, as previously described",Adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles regulate survival and function of pancreatic β-cells,"We explored the effects of extracellular vesicles (EVs), released from both rodent and human isolated adipocytes, on survival and function of pancreatic β-cells and human pancreatic islets.
Overall design: Analysis of differential expression of microRNAs in EVs from healthy and inflamed 3T3-L1 and human primary adipocytes"
