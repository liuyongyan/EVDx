Five pools, each from the NC group and the severe liver injury-CHB group, were used for NGS sequencing, and every pool contained a mixture of samples from 5 random individuals (400 µL/sample) of the same group. For the RT qPCR analysis, 1 mL of serum was taken from each sample for detection. For NTA, TEM, and WB analyses, 0.5 mL of serum was taken for detection. Each pool or sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove any larger particles. Next, each sample or pool of samples was centrifuged in a 100 KD centrifuge concentrator tube (EMD Millipore) at 3000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. Eventually, the supernatant from the previous procedure was enriched with 1/4 volume of ExoQuick-5A™ (System Biosciences, Inc., Palo Alto, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the EVs extracted were resuspended with a specific volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for different purposes and stored at −80 °C.",Characterization and MicroRNA Levels of Serum-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Hepatitis B Virus-Related diseases (human),"Serum samples were collected from patients with CHB, DeCi and normal controls. We separated EVs from serum and identified them. MiRNAs from EVs were sequenced by NGS and analyzed to obtain differentially expressed miRNAs. Then we detected the expression level of candidate miRNAs from every single sample by qRT-PCR. The differences of serum EVs in patients with liver disease and 4 miRNAs with significantly different expression levels in EVs were determined. These serum EVs and miRNAs in EVs may be candidates for diagnosing and monitoring liver disease, or important therapeutic targets for the treatment of liver disease.
Overall design: We collected Serum samples from patients with CHB, DeCi and normal controls. Every 5 samples of the same group are randomly mixed into a pool. EVs RNAs were extracted from 5 pooled CHB serum samples, 5 pooled DeCi serum samples and 5 pooled healthy serum samples. MiRNAs were sequenced by NGS and analyzed to obtain differentially expressed miRNAs."

Five pools, each from the NC group and the severe liver injury-CHB group, were used for NGS sequencing, and every pool contained a mixture of samples from 5 random individuals (400 µL/sample) of the same group. For the RT qPCR analysis, 1 mL of serum was taken from each sample for detection. For NTA, TEM, and WB analyses, 0.5 mL of serum was taken for detection. Each pool or sample was filtered through a 0.22 μm pore filter (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove any larger particles. Next, each sample or pool of samples was centrifuged in a 100 KD centrifuge concentrator tube (EMD Millipore) at 3000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. Eventually, the supernatant from the previous procedure was enriched with 1/4 volume of ExoQuick-5A™ (System Biosciences, Inc., Palo Alto, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, the EVs extracted were resuspended with a specific volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for different purposes and stored at −80 °C.",Characterization and MicroRNA Levels of Serum-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Hepatitis B Virus-Related diseases (human),"Serum samples were collected from patients with CHB, DeCi and normal controls. We separated EVs from serum and identified them. MiRNAs from EVs were sequenced by NGS and analyzed to obtain differentially expressed miRNAs. Then we detected the expression level of candidate miRNAs from every single sample by qRT-PCR. The differences of serum EVs in patients with liver disease and 4 miRNAs with significantly different expression levels in EVs were determined. These serum EVs and miRNAs in EVs may be candidates for diagnosing and monitoring liver disease, or important therapeutic targets for the treatment of liver disease.
Overall design: We collected Serum samples from patients with CHB, DeCi and normal controls. Every 5 samples of the same group are randomly mixed into a pool. EVs RNAs were extracted from 5 pooled CHB serum samples, 5 pooled DeCi serum samples and 5 pooled healthy serum samples.
