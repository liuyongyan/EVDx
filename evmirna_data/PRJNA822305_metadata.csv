Then, plasma-rich platelets (PRP) were obtained by centrifugation at 150 g for 10 min at room temperature (RT) twice to remove residual leukocytes and erythrocytes. Next, platelets were collected by centrifugation at 2000 g for 15 min, washed once using 6 ml 1 × HEPES (Macklin, Shanghai, China) and resuspended at 3 × 108/ml in DMEM. The obtained platelets were transfected with 130 nM Cy5-miR-200a-3p mimic or negative control, and shaking cultured in 8 ml DMEM medium containing 1 IU/ml thrombin (Sigma) at 37°C, 120 rpm for 24 h. The PMVs were collected by centrifugation at 2000 g for 15 min, followed by centrifugation at 120,000 g for 2 h at 4°C with TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter).

The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived retinal transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) methods and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis
Methods: The serum microvesicles of five acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and healthy controls was purified using Ribo™ Exosome Isolation Reagent (C10110-2, RIBOBIO, Guangzhou, China) and analyzed by flow cytometry and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA).The miRNA  expression profiles of serum microvesicles of five acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and healthy controls were detected by RNA-seq using llumina HiSeqTM 2500.
Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, 732 miRNA species were detected in total. The levels of 51 individual miRNA species were significantly different between AIS patients and healthy controls.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of miRNA expression profiles of serum microvesicles in AIS and healthy  controls, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of miRNA content in serum microvesicles. We conclude that RNA-seq based non-coding RNA characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.
