PRJNA647356,SRR12267548,sEV,Follicular fluid,-,-,2020-07-21,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38303722/,-,Exosomal microRNA landscape in human ovarian follicular fluid (human),"We collected ovarian follicle fluids from 68 patients and assigned them to good group or bad group according to their oocyte quality. The exosomes were isolated and characterized. Exosomal microRNAs were extracted, the library was constructed and sequenced by Illumina hiseq platform. The exosomal microRNA expression was analyzed and profiled, the target genes were predicted, GO terms were enriched by GOSeq and KEGG pathway was analyzed using miranda.A total of 47 differential microRNAs was expressed significantly between good and bad group, of which 9 microRNAs were known microRNAs and 7 of them was upregulated in the bad group. In-silico analysis indicated that several of these exosomal microRNAs were involved in pathways implicated in oocyte quality.Our study suggests that exosomal microRNAs in ovarian follicle fluid are critical in maintaining the oocyte quality. Our study greatly improve our understanding of exosomal microRNAs in human ovarian follicular fluid, paving the way for further investigation on the microRNA functions in the ovarian microenvironment and the mechanism behind it.
Overall design: 68 patients samples were collected and assigned them to good group or bad group according to their oocyte quality. Defferent expressed genes were analyzed between these two groups. The samples were pooled in two groups so we have one fastq file for each group."
