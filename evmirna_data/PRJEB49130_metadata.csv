PRJEB49130,ERR7454544,sEV,Blood|Serum,Healthy donor,-,2022-01-30,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36339820/,"The EVs in the serum were isolated using the ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation kit (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 500 μl of serum was mixed with 125 μl of ExoQuick Exosome Precipitation Solution, kept upright, and incubated for 30 min at 4°C without rotation. The mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 30 min at 4°C to spin EVs down. EVs were resuspended in PBS and stored at –80°C until required.",AD patients plasma exosome miRNA sequencing,The experiment is for demonstrating the miRNA profiles in plasma exosomes derived from mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy donors.
