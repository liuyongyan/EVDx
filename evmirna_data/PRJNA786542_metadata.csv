The flow cytometry analysis revealed 5.93% ± 0.51 apoptotic hAECs after an incubation with 5% EV-depleted FBS medium and 5.68% ± 0.11 apoptosis under normal culture conditions, which was not significantly different (p = 0.44) (Supplemental Figure 1(a)). EV-depleted FBS was obtained via the ultracentrifugation of FBS.",Transcriptome analysis the human amniotic epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (human),"We aim to explore the types and expression of miRNA in the human amniotic epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles.
Overall design: Two human amniotic epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles were analysed with miRNA sequencing."
