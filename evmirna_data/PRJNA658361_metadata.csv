Culture medium was then replaced with fresh BEGM containing 1% AA (for HBECs), advanced RPMI 1640 containing 1% AA and 2 mM L-glutamine (for BEAS-2B and NHDFs), SAGM containing 1% AA (for HSAECs), or MSC serum-free medium (SFM, Gibco) containing 1% AA (for BM-MSCs). After incubation for 48 h, conditioned medium (CM) was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore) to thoroughly remove cellular debris. For EV preparation, the CM was ultracentrifuged at 4°C for either 70 min at 35,000 r.p.m. using a SW41Ti rotor or for 45 min at 44,200 r.p.m. using a MLS50 rotor. Resulting pellets were washed by ultracentrifugation in PBS and then resuspended in PBS. Protein concentrations of the putative EV fractions were measured using a Quant-iT Protein Assay and a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). To determine the size distribution of the EVs, nanoparticle tracking analysis was carried out using the Nanosight system (NanoSight) with samples diluted 500-fold with PBS for analysis.",Human bronchial epithelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles attenuate pulmonary fibrosis through inhibiting TGF-β-WNT crosstalk [miRNA-Seq] (human),"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by devastating and progressive lung parenchymal ﬁbrosis with poor prognosis. An aberrant recapitulation of lung developmental genes including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β and WNT has been widely implicated in the abnormal wound healing process following repetitive alveolar epithelial injury during IPF pathogenesis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes and microvesicles have been shown to carry various bioactive molecules and are involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Here, we demonstrate that human bronchial epithelial cell-derived EVs (HBEC EVs) inhibited TGF-β-induced both myofibroblast differentiation and lung epithelial cellular senescence through attenuating WNT signaling. To ask how HBEC-EVs inhibited TGF-β-induced both myofibroblast differentiation and lung epithelial cellular senescence through attenuating WNT signaling, miRNA RNA-seq of HBEC-EVs was performed.
Overall design: EVs were isolated from the conditioned media of HBEC and BEAS2B (bronchial epithelial cell line) cells. Total RNAs were extracted from these EVs. miRNA-seq  analysis was performed using 20ng of EV miRNA."
