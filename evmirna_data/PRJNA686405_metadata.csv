Culture medium was collected and exosomes were obtained using serial centrifugation. The medium was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min and 2,000 × g for 10 min to remove cells or other debris and 10,000 × g for 20 min to remove other larger vesicles. Then the medium was centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 70 min, washed with 5 ml phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for another 70 min (all steps were performed at 4°C). Finally, the exosomes were obtained from the pellet and resuspended in PBS.",Deep RNA sequencing of HeLa secreted exosomes after 10ng/ml TGF-b1 treatment or no treatment (human),"Deep RNA sequceing was performed to explore the expression level of miRNAs in HeLa cell exosomes after treatment with or without 10 ng/ml TGF-β1 for 24 h. The results showed that 48 miRNAs were enriched in exosomes of HeLa cells after treated with TGF-β1 compared with non-treated cells (negative control), proving that TGF-β1 affects HeLa cell exosomes miRNA profile.
Overall design: Explore the differentially expressed miRNAs in HeLa cell exosomes after 10ng/ml TGF-b1 treatment"
