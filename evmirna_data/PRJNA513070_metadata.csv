When grown up to approximately 70% to 80% confluence, HUVECs and EPCs (Lonza) were cultured in serum-free EBM-2 medium (Lonza) for 24-40 hours. The conditioned media of both cell lines were collected and the number of both cell lines was counted. Collected culture medium was first centrifuged at 2,000 × g (Beckman Coulter) for 20 minutes to remove cellular debris, then collected by differential centrifugation (Hitachi), 10,000 × g for 30 minutes, and 100,000 × g for 120 minutes. The pelleted exosomes were resuspended with 15 ml PBS and filtered with a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore), then centrifuged at 4,000 × g to 200 μL.",Next-generation sequencing  analyzes EPC-drived exosome miRNA content and alterations of mRNA expression in exosomes treated HUVEC (human),"Purpose: To dissect the mechanisms of  EPC-drived exosome in promoting  endothelial cells reendothelialization, next-generation sequencing was used to determine exosome miRNA content and alterations in mRNA expression in HUVEC.
Methods: The miRNA of EPC-drived exosomes sequencing was carried out on the HiSeq 2500 Platform (NovelBio Corp. Laboratory, Shanghai). The data analysis was carried out with the QIAseq miRNA quantification platform using unique molecular index (UMI) counts according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The mRNA analysis of three independent samples of PBS or EPC exosomes treated HUVEC was performed using the the HiSeq 2500 Platform (NovelBio Corp. Laboratory, Shanghai) following the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays.
Results: The 20 most highly expressed microRNAs identified in EPC exosomes s are listed in Table 1. The genes predicted to be targeted by those microRNAs most highly expressed in EPC exosomes (top 20 microRNAs comprising ~75% of all reads, Table 1) are most significantly enriched in the functional category ‘blood vessel development’within the top 10 categories. Further, endothelial-specific miR-21-5P was the most highly expressed microRNA in EPC exosomes.
Conclusions:EPC exosomes promote vascular endothelial repair by delivering functional miR-21-5p.
Overall design: EPC-drived exosome miRNA  and alterations of mRNA expression in exosomes treated HUVEC analysis by deep sequencing"
