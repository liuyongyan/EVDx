The MSCs were seeded at 5000 cells per cm2 in a 150 mm dish (#20151, SPL Life Sciences Co. Ltd.). When they reached 80–90% confluency, the culture medium was replaced with α-MEM containing 10% EV-depleted FBS. After 48 h, the culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 300g for 3 min to remove cell debris. After centrifugation at 2000g for 10 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, centrifuged again at 10,000g for 30 min, and ultracentrifuged at 178,000g for 2 h. OptiPrep™ (iodixanol) density gradient ultracentrifugation was performed to obtain highly purified EVs","Expression profiles of salivary gland MSC or wharton's jelly MSC, and their extracellular vesicles (human)","MSCs from salivary gland or wharton's jelly were subjected to gene expression analysis, and their extracellular vesicles were used for exosomal miRNA profiling.
Overall design: RNAseq from 2 different MSCs and miRNAseq from 2 different MSC's derivative extracellular vesicle (n=3)."
