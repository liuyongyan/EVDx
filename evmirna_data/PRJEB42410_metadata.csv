In this study, we aimed to characterize small RNA content of plasma exosomes from ARDS patients in order to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers of the disease. For the first time, we profiled miRNA expression levels in plasma-derived exosomes from ARDS patients (n=8) compared to healthy subjects (n=10) by small RNA-seq. It allowed us to identify 12 exosomal miRNAs differentially expressed in ARDS context (padj<0.05)."

Then, plasma (2 ml) was resuspended in PBS (25 ml) and precleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 120 min at 4°C. The supernatants were passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore). To isolate exosomes, the precleared supernatants of plasma were ultracentrifuged at 110,000 rpm for 120 min at 4°C, followed by washing of the exosome pellet with PBS at 110,000 rpm for 120 min at 4°C (Optima XPN-80 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter, SW32 rotor). The supernatant was discarded, and the exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS or lysed with Qiazol and stored at −80°C. Exosomes were characterized by dynamic light scattering.",Small RNA-Seq of plasma-derived exosomes from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome patients and healthy subjects,"Despite a significant progress in the treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), our ability to identify early patients and predict outcome remains limited. In this study, we aimed to characterize small RNA content of plasma exosomes from ARDS patients in order to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers of the disease. For the first time, we profiled miRNA expression levels in plasma-derived exosomes from ARDS patients (n=8) compared to healthy subjects (n=10) by small RNA-seq. It allowed us to identify 12 exosomal miRNAs differentially expressed in ARDS context (padj<0.05)."

Plasma was isolated from the blood by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 10 min at 4°C to remove blood cells, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C to remove platelets and cell debris. Then, plasma (2 ml) was resuspended in PBS (25 ml) and precleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 120 min at 4°C. The supernatants were passed through a 0.22-μm filter (Millipore).
