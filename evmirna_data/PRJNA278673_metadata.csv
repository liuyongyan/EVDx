Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum until 80% confluent. The cells were then washed three times with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cultured for 24 hr in serum-free medium. The medium was collected and replaced with ionomycin-containing medium for 1 hr, after which ionomycin-containing medium was collected and pooled with the previously collected serum-free medium. Pooled media was centrifuged for 10 min at 300×g to remove cellular debris, and the resulting supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22-mm polyethersulfone filter (Nalgene, Rochester, NY, USA) to reduce microparticle contamination. The filtrate was concentrated ∼300-fold with a 100,000 molecular weight cut-off centrifugal concentrator (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The concentrate was then subjected to high-speed centrifugation at 150,000×g for 2 hr. The resulting exosome-enriched pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 25 mM hydroxyethyl-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (pH 7.2) and washed by centrifuging again at 150,000×g for 3 hr. The wash steps were repeated a minimum of three times until no trace of phenol red was detected. The resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), and protein concentrations were determined with a MicroBCA kit (Pierce/Thermo, Rockford, IL, USA). The number of exosomes per μg of protein was determined by means of nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight, Wiltshire, UK). Analysis was performed on three independent preparations of exosomes.",Homo sapiens (human),"Although long thought to act cell autonomously, mutant KRAS colorectal cancer (CRC) cells release protein-laden exosomes that can alter the tumor microenvironment.  We have previously shown that mutant KRAS induces EGFR-ligand trafficking to exosomes and drastically alters exosomal protein contents, leading to activities that contribute to neoplastic growth. We have performed small library RNAseq analysis on cells and matched exosomes from isogenic CRC cell lines differing only in KRAS status to determine whether mutant KRAS regulates the composition of secreted small RNAs. Exosomal small RNA profiles were distinct from cellular profiles, with principle component analysis showing clusters of mutant KRAS cell-derived exosomes distinct from wild type KRAS cell-derived exosomes. Secreted RNA species encompassed several different classes of small RNAs, including ribosomal and tRNA fragments, as well as mature miRNA sequences. miR-10b, was selectively increased in wild type KRAS-derived exosomes, whereas miR-100 was selectively increased in mutant KRAS-derived exosomes.  Ceramide inhibition resulted in accumulation of miR-100 in mutant KRAS cells, suggesting KRAS-dependent miRNA export.  In Transwell cell culture experiments, mutant, but not wild type, KRAS donor cells conferred miR-100-mediated target repression in wild type KRAS recipient cells
Overall design: miRNAseq deep sequencing for both cell and exosome mirnas of Dks-8, DLD-1, and DKO-1 cell lines. The DKs-8 line contains a wild type KRAS alleles, the DLD-1 line contains both wild type and mutant (G13D) KRAS alleles, and the DKO-1 line contains only a mutant KRAS allele."
