Commercially available size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column (qEVsingle/70 nm by Izon Sciences, UK) was used for the isolation of EVs.

After the sample had passed down, DPBS was added immediately on the top of the column filter and a total of 20 fractions, 200 µL each, were collected separately.

The origin and potential functions of such RNAs in human pre-ovulatory follicle, the environment of oocyte maturation, are unclear. We aimed to describe the small RNA profiles of three follicular compartments of the same follicle: mural granulosa cells (MGC), cell-free follicular fluid (FF) and extracellular vesicles (EV) of the FF. Focusing on microRNAs, their signatures and regulated pathways were compared between infertile women with polycystic ovaries and fertile control group.
