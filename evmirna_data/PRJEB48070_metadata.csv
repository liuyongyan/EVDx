PRJEB48070,ERR7015676,sEV,Foreskin|Prostate,-,-,2021-11-07,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34938180/,"The transmission electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of exosomes isolated from liquid ECM by ultracentrifugation. Exosomes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) overnight. Then the samples were rinsed in PBS and refixed in 1% osmium tetroxide at 4°C overnight. After dehydrated in increasing concentrations of acetone, samples were embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were prepared and adsorbed to formvar-coated copper grids. Samples were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then photographed using Tecnai transmission electron microscope (FEI, United States).","The comparison of exosomal miRNAs from ECM or media derived from HFF-CBD-Lamp2b cells, HFF cells, HFF-Lamp2b cells and hUCMSCs","The next-generation sequencing technology was used to investigate the difference of RNAs content among the different types of exosomes from the media of HFF cells, HFF-Lamp2b cells and hUCMSCs, and from the ECM of HFF-CBD-Lamp2b cells"
