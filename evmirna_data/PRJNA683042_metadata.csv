PRJNA683042,SRR13208980,sEV,Human beta cells|Pancreas|Primary cell,Healthy donor,High glucose solution,2020-12-10,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34055806/,"A culture supernatant was obtained from human beta cells cultured in serum-free medium. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 5 min and the culture supernatant was concentrated using centrifugal filter units (Millipore, MA, United States) by centrifugation at 2,000 g for 20 min. EVs in the supernatant were isolated by size exclusion chromatography using a qEV original size exclusion column (IZON science, Oxford, United Kingdom). The sample was added to the column and seven to nine 0.5 ml fractions were obtained and concentrated.",miRNAs profile in extracellular vesicles derived from human  beta cells (human),"miRNAs profiles in extracellular vesicles derived from human  beta cells were analyzed using RNA-seq
Overall design: For analysis the change of miRNAs profile in extracellular vesicles derived from human beta cells, the human beta cells were incubited with solution of low glucose (2 mM) and high glucose (20 mM) respectively for 30 min, then the cell supernatant were selected to isolate the extracellular vesicles using XX method,"
