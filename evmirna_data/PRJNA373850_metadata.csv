The 2000g supernatant fluid was then centrifuged at 12,000g for 45 minutes at 4°C (Sorvall® high-speed microcentrifuge, fixed rotor). The resultant supernatant fluid (2 mL) was transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube (Beckman; 10 mL) and centrifuged at 100,000g for 2 hours (Sorvall® T-8100 fixed ultracentrifuge rotor). 
The 100,000g pellet was suspended in PBS (10 mL) and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (SteritopTM; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and then centrifuged at 100,000g for 2 hours. The 100,000g pellet was resuspended in 500 μL PBS and layered on the top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient containing 40% (weight-to-volume ratio [w/v]), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v), and 5% (w/v) iodixanol and centrifuged at 100,000g for 20 hours. Solutions were made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60% [w/v] aqueous iodixanol from Sigma-Aldrich). An exosome-containing fraction (density, 1.12 to 1.19 g/mL) was collected, diluted with PBS, and centrifuged at 100,000g for 2 hours at 4°C. Finally, the pellet containing the enriched exosome population was resuspended in 50 μL PBS. Exosomes were characterized by measuring the size distribution, detecting TSG101 (ab125011) expression, and examining morphology using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), Western blot, and transmission electron microscopy, respectively.",Homo sapiens (human),"Preeclampsia (PE) and its related diseases is one of the most significant pregnancy complications, occurring at an incidence of 3-5% and is responsible for nearly 40% of premature births delivered before 35 weeks. There is a need to develop strategies for early prediction of patients who will develop PE, in order to establish preventive strategies to reduce the prevalence and severity of the disease and their associated aftereffects. Therefore, a prospective cohort of patients were recruited at three time points during pregnancy for each patient (i.e. 11-14 (early gestational age), 22-24 (middle gestational age) and 32-36 (late gestational age) weeks gestation). A retrospective stratified study design was used to characterize miRNAs in exosomes derived from maternal plasma of normal (n=32 per time point) and PE (n=15 per time point) pregnancies.
Overall design: miRNAs were profiled from exosomes using next generation seqeuencing, utilizing the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform"
