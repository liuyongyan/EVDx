The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of isolation buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 7.6, 50 μl of dithiothreitol) to reduce the highly abundant Tamm-Horsfall protein. After incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes, the sample was briefly vortexed and centrifuged again at 17,000g for 15 minutes. This supernatant was then combined with the initial supernatant and centrifuged once more at 17,000g for 150 minutes.
