PRJNA522921,SRR8586300,sEV,Synovial fluid,Healthy donor,-,2019-02-19,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30944259/,"For isolation of EVs from in vitro cultured cells, conditioned medium was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 rcf for 20 minutes at 4°C to remove cells and cell debris; the supernatant containing EVs was then centrifuged at 100,000 rcf for 70 minutes at 4°C. The EV pellet was suspended in PBS and centrifuged at 100,000 rcf again to eliminate contaminant proteins and nucleic acids. The pellet was then resuspended in PBS and store at –80°C until use. Isolation of EVs from synovial fluid was performed similarly, but synovial fluid was first diluted 1:4 with PBS prior to differential centrifugation.",miRNA sequencing of synovial fluid derived extracellular vesicles between normal and osteoarthritis  (OA) patients (human),"To determine whether extracellular vesicles were also present in human disease, we isolated and evaluated extracellular vesicles from synovial fluid from normal and OA patients at relatively advanced ages (70 - 80 years). Here we report the altered expression of synovial fluid extracellular vesicles-derived miRNAs in osteoarthritis compared to normal patients with age-relate degeneration to investigate potential biomarkers for OA diagnosis.  The OA donors had clinical evidence of OA based on pain that led to total joint arthroplasty.
Overall design: Examination of miRNA expression in extracellular vesicles isolated from synovial fluids of normal and osteoarthritis patients"
