EVs from 4 mL of clarified supernatant were purified using SEC as described above. Then, fractions containing EVs were pooled, concentrated, and purified by isopycnic ultracentrifugation as above.",Comparison of EVs isolation methods for miRNAs sequencing (human),"Background & aims:  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) encapsulated in EVs are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. However, discrepancies on miRNA patterns and their validation are still frequent due to differences in sample origin, EVs isolation, miRNA extraction and sequencing methods. Selecting appropriate EVs isolation methods is therefore a critical step for miRNA-based biomarker discovery. The aim of the present study is to find the most suitable EVs isolation method for miRNAs sequencing adequate for clinical application.  Material & Methods EVs were isolated by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), iodixanol gradients (GRAD) and the combination of both (SEC+GRAD), using the same plasma sample, in triplicate isolation assays. Isolated EVs were characterized and RNA was extracted. Three different protocols for miRNA library preparation were compared (NEBNext, NEXTFlex and SMARTer smRNA-seq) and miRNAs encapsulated on EVs were sequenced using NextSeq 500 system (Illumina). Finally, the yield, abundance and diversity of miRNAs using the three different EVs isolation protocols were analyzed and compared between them.  Results The majority of lipoproteins, total cholesterol and plasma proteins were removed from the EVs-containing fractions by using SEC, GRAD, and SEC+GRAD. SEC method recovered a larger amount of EVs followed by GRAD and SEC+GRAD, while GRAD and SEC+GRAD yielded the purest vesicles. NEBNext was the library preparation kit that showed the highest reproducibility among replicas, higher number of reads corresponding to miRNAs and more different miRNAs, followed by NEXTFlex and SMARTer smRNA-seq. GRAD method showed the highest reproducibility among replicas, a higher number of reads corresponding to miRNAs and more different miRNAs, followed by SEC and SEC+GRAD methods.   Conclusions These results render the GRAD method to isolate EVs as one of the most appropriate to detect miRNAs from Evs.

GRAD method showed the highest reproducibility among replicas, a higher number of reads corresponding to miRNAs and more different miRNAs, followed by SEC and SEC+GRAD methods.   Conclusions These results render the GRAD method to isolate EVs as one of the most appropriate to detect miRNAs from Evs.
Overall design: Comparative miRNA abundance of 3 different miRNA preparation kits (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), NEXTFlex Small RNA-Seq Kit v3 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA), and SMARTer smRNA-seq kit (Clontech Laboratories, CA, USA)) and 3 different extracellular vesicles protocols (Size exclusion chromatography (SEC), Isopycnic ultracentrifugation using iodixanol gradients (GRAD), and Combination of SEC and GRAD (SEC+GRAD))"

However, discrepancies on miRNA patterns and their validation are still frequent due to differences in sample origin, EVs isolation, miRNA extraction and sequencing methods. Selecting appropriate EVs isolation methods is therefore a critical step for miRNA-based biomarker discovery. The aim of the present study is to find the most suitable EVs isolation method for miRNAs sequencing adequate for clinical application.  Material & Methods EVs were isolated by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), iodixanol gradients (GRAD) and the combination of both (SEC+GRAD), using the same plasma sample, in triplicate isolation assays. Isolated EVs were characterized and RNA was extracted. Three different protocols for miRNA library preparation were compared (NEBNext, NEXTFlex and SMARTer smRNA-seq) and miRNAs encapsulated on EVs were sequenced using NextSeq 500 system (Illumina). Finally, the yield, abundance and diversity of miRNAs using the three different EVs isolation protocols were analyzed and compared between them.  Results The majority of lipoproteins, total cholesterol and plasma proteins were removed from the EVs-containing fractions by using SEC, GRAD, and SEC+GRAD. SEC method recovered a larger amount of EVs followed by GRAD and SEC+GRAD, while GRAD and SEC+GRAD yielded the purest vesicles. NEBNext was the library preparation kit that showed the highest reproducibility among replicas, higher number of reads corresponding to miRNAs and more different miRNAs, followed by NEXTFlex and SMARTer smRNA-seq.
