Briefly, supernatants were centrifuged at 300g for 10 minutes and 2000g for 30 minutes to remove floating cells and dead cells, then, at 10 000g for 30 minutes to remove cell debris and broken organelles. Finally, a higher speed centrifugation at 100 000g for 70 minutes were performed to collect pellet exosomes from supernatant. For further purification, the pellets were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 100 000g for 70 minutes again. All centrifugation temperatures were at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in PBS, then, immediately used or stored at −80°C until use. The exosomes were quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay.",Small RNA sequencing facilitates  analysis of exosomal RNA transcriptomes (human),"Smal RNA is a type of single-stranded small-molecule RNA with a size of about 18-40 bases, mainly including microRNA, piRNA, snoRNA, snRNA, tRNA and so on. Small RNAs have important regulatory functions in cells and have the potential to be used as disease diagnostic markers or drug targets. We report the results of all small RNAs in exosomes from HTNV infected/uninfected HUVECs by high-throughput sequencing technology. We find that  the transcriptomes of Exo-NC group (exosomes from HTNV uninfected cells) and Exo-HV group (exosomes from HTNV infected cells) expressed distinctly different expression patterns of miRNA.
