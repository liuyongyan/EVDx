PRJNA983206,SRR24904647,sEV,Blood|Plasma|platelet rich plasma,Healthy donor,-,2023-11-30,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA983206/,-,miRNA sequencing detecting miRNA cargo from PRP derived exosomes isolated from young donors and old donors (human),"We detected and compared the miRNAs contained in Y-PRP-exos or O-PRP-exos. The results showed that most miRNAs (38) can be identified in both Y-PRP-exos and O-PRP-exos. In addition, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p and hsa-miR-126-3p were top 3 enriched miRNAs in PRP-exos of all donors. These results indicated the heterogeneity of miRNAs in PRP-exos was small, regardless of age. However, the abundance of miRNAs in Y-PRP-exos and O-PRP-exos was quite different, especially in high-ranking miRNAs. The expression of hsa-miR-16-5p and has-let-7f-5p in O-PRP-exos in two old donors was only approximately 1/4-1/2 of that in Y-PRP-exos in two young donors
Overall design: To investigate the miRNAs in PRP-exosomes that could regulate adipogenesis and proliferation of Pdgfrα+ progenitors and fatty infiltration in muscle injury, we isolated PRP exosomes derived from two young donors and two old donors, respectively, and compared the enriched miRNAs."
