The supernatant was taken and centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 minutes at 4°C. Then, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000g for 70 minutes at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in PBS buffer and ultracentrifuged again at 100,000g for 70 minutes. After ultracentrifugation, the pellet was suspended with 50 μL PBS buffer and saved at –80°C.",Expression of miRNA in exosomes from transudative pleural effusion and tuberculous pleural effusions (human),"Pleural fibrosis is defined as an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) that results in destruction of the normal pleural tissue architecture and compromised function. However there is currently no effective medication for pleural fibrosis. Understanding the detailed mechanisms of pleural fibrosis is an important unmet need which could lead to the identification of new targets for treatment of this condition.  microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression. In our study, cellular fractions from TBPE contained activities capable of promoting fibrosis-like behavior in pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs), the goal of this study is to compare the exosomal miRNA composition of TBPE and TPE.   We isolated exosomes from transudative pleural effusion and tuberculous pleural effusions and performed miRNA sequencing.  Our study represents the first detailed analysis of exosomal miRNA composition of TBPE and TPE with biologic replicates, generated by miRNA-Seq technology.
Overall design: Three independent  preparations of exosomes from transudative pleural effusion or tuberculous pleural effusions"
