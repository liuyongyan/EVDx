PRJNA625058,SRR11540685,sEV,Neuronal-derived exosomes from plasma|Plasma,Depressed,-,2021-10-31,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34385599/,"EVs were isolated from 2 mL of plasma using a qEV 70 size exclusion column from Izon Science (Christchurch, New Zealand). Plasma was added to the column, and elutant was collected in half mL fractions. Fractions seven, eight, and nine were kept as the plasma EV fraction. A portion of EV fraction was kept for characterization. The remaining was concentrated to 250 µL using the Amicon Ultra 4 mL centrifugal filter for neuron enrichment (MilliporeSigma, United States).",Neuron-derived exosome from plasma show altered miRNA cargo as a function of antidepressant drug response. (human),"We investigated NDEs from depressed and psychiatrically healthy controls, before and after, eight weeks of antidepressant treatment (ADT).  Neuronal-derived exosomes contained miRNA that showed enrichment for brain functions. Changes in NDE cargo, specifically miR-21-5p, miR-30d-5p, and miR-486-5p expression, were significantly associated with ADT response. Furthermore, we found these targets to be altered in brain tissue from depressed individuals. Together, our study indicates that changes in peripherally isolated NDE can act as a biomarker of ADT response specifically through size and cargo.
Overall design: MiRNA cargo of neuronal-derived  exosomes from 40 MDD patients, half of which responded to antidepressant treatment, and half of which did not. In addition, 20 psychiatrically healthy controls were used. Data is included from exosomes extracted both before and after treatment."
