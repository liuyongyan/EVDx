PRJNA535491,SRR8956086,lEV,Human LOX melanoma cells|Primary cell|Skin,Melanoma,-,2019-04-26,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235936/,"The cells used for TMV isolation were plated and incubated to approximately 80% confluency at the time of conditioned media collection. Conditioned media was collected from the cells and the culture vessel was rinsed once with sterile PBS, which was subsequently added to the collected media. The mixture was then centrifuged for 15 min at 300g to remove cells and large debris. The supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 2,000g to pellet the apoptotic bodies. The TMVs were then isolated by centrifugation at 10,000g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was washed twice in sterile PBS and a final isolation was performed before downstream use.",An ARF6-Exportin-5 Axis Delivers pre-miRNA Cargo to Tumor Microvesicles. (human),"MicroRNA sequencing reads in TMVs showed a significant increase with ARF6 activation
Overall design: Examine the miRNA populations in TMVs shed by LOX parental cells and ARF6-active cells"
