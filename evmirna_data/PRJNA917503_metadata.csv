Blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min at 4 ∘C to collect supernatants. Supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4 ∘C and filtered using a 0.22 µm filter membrane. The supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 120,000 g for 1.5 h at 4 ∘C.

In this study, we aimed to make contribution to understanding pathogenesis of ASD and screen for the potential biomarkers associated with the occurrence and development of ASD.
Overall design: Exosomes were extracted from peripheral blood of ten children with ASD and ten normal children. The identification of exosomes was assessed with transmission electron microscopy and Western blot analysis. Then, RNA sequencing was conducted to investigate the exosomal miRNA profile of ASD. The mRNA and circRNA expression profiles of ASD were acquired from GEO database. With identification of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and circRNAs (DEcircRNAs), a ceRNA regulatory network was constructed. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration in ASD was evaluated."

In this study, we aimed to make contribution to understanding pathogenesis of ASD and screen for the potential biomarkers associated with the occurrence and development of ASD.
Overall design: Exosomes were extracted from peripheral blood of ten children with ASD and ten normal children. The identification of exosomes was assessed with transmission electron microscopy and Western blot analysis. Then, RNA sequencing was conducted to investigate the exosomal miRNA profile of ASD. The mRNA and circRNA expression profiles of ASD were acquired from GEO database. With identification of differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and circRNAs (DEcircRNAs), a ceRNA regulatory network was constructed. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration in ASD was evaluated."
