PRJNA769670,SRR16248703,sEV,Cell line|Cell line/SCC-9|Tongue,Tongue squamous cell carcinoma,-,2021-10-12,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34900962/,-,The transcriptome sequencing of Chrysin treated Scc9 Extracellular vesicles (human),"EVs-Chrysin(Chrysin-treated SCC9) were isolated from SCC9 cells that were treated with chrysin. To improve the therapeutic effect, AuNPs were carried by EVs-Chrysin (Au-EVs). Compared to BGC823 and HCC-LM3 cells, the uptake of Au-EVs were specific in SCC9 cells. Moreover, Au-EVs combined with NIR enhanced cell apoptosis in TSCC cells. To confirm the role of miRNAs in cell apoptosis, the differentially expressed miRNAs between EVs-Con and EVs-Chrysin were screened by RNA-seq.
Overall design: RNA-seq screen differentially expressed miRNAs between EVs-Con and EVs-Chrysin."
