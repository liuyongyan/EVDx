[18]. Briefly: each cell culture media sample was spun down at 300×g for 10 minutes (4°C), followed by 2,000×g for 20 min (4°C) to eliminate dead cells, then 10,000×g for another 30 min (4°C) to remove debris. The media was then pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000×g for 70 min at 4°C; the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in 1 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged again at 100,000×g for 70 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was re-suspended in 200μL PBS and stored at -80°C until further analysis.",Homo sapiens (human),"Exosomes are nano-sized (40-150 nm), membrane encapsulated vesicles that are released by cells into the extracellular space and function as intercellular signaling vectors through the horizontal transfer of biologic molecules, including microRNA (miRNA). Although secreted by both normal and malignant cells, there is evidence that cancer-derived exosomes enable the tumor to manipulate its microenvironment, contributing to the capacity of the tumor for immune evasion, growth, invasion, and metastatic spread.
Overall design: The purpose of this study was to apply miRNA-sequencing to exosomes isolated from conditioned culture media to comprehensively characterize miRNA secreted in exosomes from 4 distinct head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and normal oral epithelial cells."
