We isolated CPCs from cardiac biopsies of patients with congenital heart disease using magnetic bead sorting. We expanded CPCs, reduced serum for 24hrs, and collected secreted EVs from conditioned media with sequential ultracentrifugation. We isolate RNA from CPCs and CPC-EVs and sequence total RNA and miRNA. Sequencing was performed in at two different facilities: ""E"" and ""N"".
Overall design: Examination of CPC and CPC-derived EV small RNA content."
