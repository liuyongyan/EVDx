The medium was centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 minutes in an Eppendorf 5804R using an S-4-104 rotor to pellet out the cells. The supernatant was then passed through a 0.22 μm VWR vacuum filtration (76010–402). The conditioned media was further concentrated by Minimate TFF Capsules (100KDa cut-off, Pall, OA100C12) to 50 mL. The remaining 50 mL supernatant was split in 50mL conical tubes where 1:1 volume of 16% (2X) polyethylene glycol (average Mn, 6000; Alfa Aesar; 25322-68-3) and 1 M sodium chloride was added to samples and incubated overnight at 4°C. The incubated samples were centrifuged at 3,214 × g for 1 hour in an S-4-104 rotor. The pellet from each tube was then washed with 1mL of 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 70 min in a Beckman MAX-E using the TLA120.2 rotor. The collected EV Samples were resuspended in about 300 μL of particle-free PBS for nanoparticle tracking analysis or protein quantification to be used in functional assays and RNA-seq.",EBV LMP1 manipulates the content and functions of extracellular vesicles to enhance metastatic potential of recipient cells [miRNA-seq] (human),"EBV oncogene LMP1 modified EV contents. We identified about 32 upregulated and 25 downregulated miRNAs which were statistically significant (P<0.05) and most of them were changed dramatically with Log2-fold change more than 5.
Overall design: Extracellular vesicles were isolated either from HK1 or LMP1 transfected HK1 cell line."
