First, thawed serum was centrifuged for 30 min at 500 x g. Further, to get rid of larger debris and apoptotic bodies, the supernatant was centrifuged for 45 min at 12,000 x g. Then, it was filtered using 0.2/0.8 µm Acrodisc® PF syringe filters (Pall, Port Washington, NY, United States) and transferred to Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit with a 100 kDa cut-off (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), filled with Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (Biowest, Nuaillé, France) and centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm to enrich the exosomal fraction and to decrease the viscosity of the sample. Concentrated samples were diluted again in PBS, transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 90 min at 120,000 x g (fixed angle rotor 70.1 Ti, Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, United States). All centrifuge steps were performed at 4°C. ",MiRNAs from serum-derived extracellular vesicles as biomarkers for uveal melanoma progression,"For characterisation of the miRNA profiles present in circulating serum-derived exosomes of patients with diagnosed primary and metastatic UM, we have analysed the miRNA cargos using next-generation sequencing followed by RT-qPCR validation in a cohort of patients (control n=20; primary n=9; metastatic n=11)."
