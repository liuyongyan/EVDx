A total of 2–5 mL of cell-depleted SF was thawed, treated with hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia) at 30 U/mL and DNase I (Worthington, Biochemical, Lakewood, CA, USA) at 20 U/mL for 15 min at 37 °C. Enzyme-treated, cell-depleted SF was diluted to 13 mL with 4.84 mM EDTA/DPBS and centrifuged at 10,000× g (avg) (11,700 RPM, k-Factor = 1563) for 30 min at 4 °C in a 70 Ti rotor using polycarbonate tubes (Beckman Coulter, Mount Waverley, VIC, Australia). The supernatant was collected and injected into a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR prepacked gel filtration column and eluted with 4.84 mM EDTA/DPBS at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. SEC eluent from 6–120 min was collected, transferred to polycarbonate tubes and ultracentrifuged at 100,000× g (avg) (36,900 RPM, k-factor = 157) in a 70 Ti rotor for 90 min at 4 °C to concentrate EVs. EV pellets were resuspended in 250 µL of DPBS and stored at −80 °C until the time of RNA extraction.

A total of 2–5 mL of cell-depleted SF was thawed, treated with hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, Macquarie Park, NSW, Australia) at 30 U/mL and DNase I (Worthington, Biochemical, Lakewood, CA, USA) at 20 U/mL for 15 min at 37 °C. Enzyme-treated, cell-depleted SF was diluted to 13 mL with 4.84 mM EDTA/DPBS and centrifuged at 10,000× g (avg) (11,700 RPM, k-Factor = 1563) for 30 min at 4 °C in a 70 Ti rotor using polycarbonate tubes (Beckman Coulter, Mount Waverley, VIC, Australia). The supernatant was collected and injected into a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-500 HR prepacked gel filtration column and eluted with 4.84 mM EDTA/DPBS at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. SEC eluent from 6–120 min was collected, transferred to polycarbonate tubes and ultracentrifuged at 100,000× g (avg) (36,900 RPM, k-factor = 157) in a 70 Ti rotor for 90 min at 4 °C to concentrate EVs. EV pellets were resuspended in 250 µL of DPBS and stored at −80 °C until the time of RNA extraction.
