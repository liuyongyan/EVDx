Briefly, prostate cancer cells were cultured in EV-free medium for 24 h before sEVs isolation. EV-free medium is consisted of DMEM, 10% EV-depleted FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. EV-depleted FBS was either produced in-house by ultracentrifugation of serum at 110,000 g for 16 h (SW 32 Ti rotor, k-factor: 231.2, 30056 rpm) followed by sterile filtration through a 0.2 μm filter (Millipore) or purchased from Systembio (Cat.no EXO-FBS-50A-1). The supernatant from 107 donor cells was collected and centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min and 3000 g for 15 min to remove cell debris and apoptotic bodies. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged at 18,000 g for 30 min to further remove lEVs. sEVs were pelleted via ultracentrifugation at 110,000 g for 70 min. The pelleted sEVs were washed in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;Hyclone, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) and centrifuged again. For sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation, after a single wash step described above, the pelleted sEVs were resuspended in control DMEM without PBS or penicillin-streptomycin. sEV-contained DMEM was loaded over 30% sucrose solution (prepared in D2O) slowly without mixing the two layers, and centrifuged at 110,000 g, 4°C for 2 h (SW 32 Ti rotor, k-factor: 231.2, 30056 rpm).",Prostate cancer-derived small extracellular vesicles promote osteoclastogenesis and cancer-induced osteolysis via miR-152-3p delivery (human),"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play critical roles in regulating bone metastatic microenvironment through mediating intercellular communications. Here, we report a direct regulatory mode between tumor cells and osteoclasts in osteolytic metastasis of prostate cancer via vesicular miRNAs transfer. Combined analysis of miRNAs profiles both in tumor-derived small EVs (sEVs) and osteoclasts identified miR-152-3p as a potential osteolytic molecules. Further in vitro experiments showed that sEVs were enriched in miR-152-3p, which targets osteoclastogenic regulator MAFB. Blocking miR-152-3p in sEVs upregulated the expression of MAFB and impaired osteoclastogenesis in recipient osteoclasts. In vivo xenograft mouse model found that blocking of miR-152-3p in sEVs significantly rescued the loss of trabecular architecture, while systemic inhibition of miR-152-3p using antagomiR-152-3p reduced the osteolytic lesions of cortical bone while remaining the basic trabecular architecture. Together, our findings suggest that miR-152-3p carried by prostate cancer-derived sEVs deliver osteolytic signals from tumor cells to osteoclasts, facilitating osteolytic progression in bone metastasis.
