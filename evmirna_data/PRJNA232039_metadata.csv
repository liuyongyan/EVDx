PRJNA232039,SRR1054269,sEV,Blood|Plasma,-,-,2014-06-02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24593312/,-,Homo sapiens (human),"we performed RNA sequencing analysis using 7 human plasma samples and evaluated efficiency and accuracy of eRNA on miRNA-seq data analysis.
Overall design: We sequenced microRNAs from the 7 human tissue samples with replicates (A1/A8, B2/B9, C3/C10, D4/D11, E5/E12, F6/F13, G7/G14) using NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA library Prep Set from New England Biolab (NEB). After that, we identified miRNAs in these plasma samples against known human matured miRNAs."
