For each sample, 1 µl of the final RNA eluate was used for measurement of small RNA concentration by Agilent Bioanalyzer Small RNA Assay using Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert instrument (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A small RNA concentration of 200 pg/ul was considers as a cutoff for subsequent library preparation.",Differential expression of  circulating exosomal microRNAs  in refractory intracranial  atherosclerosis associated with  antiangiogenesis (human),"Purpose:We aimed to investigate the role of circulating exosomal microRNAs (e-miRNAs) in recurrent ischemic events in ICAD
Methods: consecutive patients with severe ICAD undergoing intensive medical management (IMM) were prospectively enrolled. Those with recurrent ischemic events despite IMM during 6-month follow up were algorithmically matched to IMM responders. Baseline blood e-miRNA expression levels of the matched patients were measured using next generation sequencing
Results: a  total   of 122 e-miRNAs were isolated from blood samples of 10 non-responders and 11 responders. Thirteen e-miRNAs predicted IMM failure with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) determined 10 of the 13 e-miRNAs were significantly associated with angiogenesis-related biological functions (p < 0.025) and angiogenic factors that have been associated with recurrent ischemic events in ICAD. These e-miRNAs included miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p, miR-27b-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-486-5p, miR-30c-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-10a-5p, miR-101-3p, and miR-24-3p. As predicted by IPA, the specific expression profiles of these 10 e-miRNAs in non-responders had a net result of inhibition of the angiogenesis-related functions and up expression of the antiangiogenic factors
conclusion: This study revealed distinct expression profiles of circulating e-miRNAs in refractory ICAD, suggesting an antiangiogenic mechanism underlying IMM failure.
Overall design: survey of intracranial atherosclerosis patients receiving IMM to associate the e-miRNA expression profile with recurrent ischemic events despite treatment."

conclusion: This study revealed distinct expression profiles of circulating e-miRNAs in refractory ICAD, suggesting an antiangiogenic mechanism underlying IMM failure.
