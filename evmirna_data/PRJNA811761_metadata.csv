Isolated exosomes were validated by transmission electron microscopy and Western blot detecting CD63 and TSG101, biomarkers of exosomes.",Small RNA sequencing of CIT-treated L-02,"The exosomes were derived from CIT-treated L-02 hepatocytes. With exosomal small RNA sequencing, we found differentially expressed miRNAs in the exosomes from CIT-treated L-02 cells, and the predicted target genes of exosomal miRNAs were enriched in calcium signaling pathway."
