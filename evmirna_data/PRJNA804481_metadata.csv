PRJNA804481,SRR18210521,sEV,Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)|Primary cell,Healthy donor,-,2024-04-01,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35495944/,"EVs from HUVECs culture were isolated as described below to avoid the effect of other possible contaminants (e.g., cells debris, TRLs and most of proteins). The culture medium was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm, 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation (Beckman XL-90 ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter) at 100,000 g for 90 min at 4°C without brake. The pellet with the EVs was subjected to a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Izon qEVs 30 nm (Izon Science Europe Ltd, Oxford, UK), and the pooled fractions 7–9 (enriched in EVs) were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 g for 90 min at 4°C. After, the EVs isolated were resuspended in 200 μl of M199 medium. Hundred microliter of EVs were used for the incubation of SMCs, and other aliquots were kept at −80°C for electron microscopy, western blot, nanoparticle tracking and miRNA analysis.",Homo sapiens (human),Scope
