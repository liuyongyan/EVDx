Briefly: ectopic tissue was disaggregated into a single cell suspension with type IV collagenase (Solarbio, China). Leucorrhea was diluted with PBS to make a mixed solution. The supernatant and leucorrhea solution were centrifuged at 4 °C with a high-speed centrifuge (Thermo, USA) at 500 g for 10 min to remove living cells, 2000 g for 10 min to remove dead cells, and 10,000 g for 20 min to eliminate the cell debris. Every step was repeated twice. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 g twice with ultracentrifuge (Beckman, USA) for 70 min each time. The exosomes were resuspended or lysed with different reagents for subsequent experiments.",Human tRF&tiRNA Sequencing for exosomes derived from ectopic endometrial tissues in EMs patients (human),"We digested and extracted tissue exosomes from fresh ectopic endometrial tissue and control endometrial tissue, and analyzed the expression of tRF&tiRNA in the two groups of exosomes through high-throughput sequencing
Overall design: Exosomes derived from ectopic endometrial tissue and control endometrial tissue"
