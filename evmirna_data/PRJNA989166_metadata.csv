PRJNA989166,SRR25072864,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Obese,-,2024-07-01,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37697228/,"Venous blood was collected in the morning after an overnight fast and plasma was separated. Exosomes were isolated from plasma using an ultracentrifuge (CP100MX, Hitachi, Japan). Plasma was first centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C to remove larger vesicles. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane to eliminate larger particles and then centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 70 min at 4 °C. The resulting particles were resuspended in 10 mL of pre-chilled PBS and subjected to another centrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 70 min at 4 °C. The collected precipitate represented exosomes after removing the supernatant. ",Sequencing of human circulating exosomal miRNA,"In this study, circulating plasma exosomes from obese patients were first extracted by ultracentrifugation, and then plasma exosome miRNA expression profiles were obtained using high-throughput histology techniques; the differences in plasma exosome miRNA expression profiles between obese patients and healthy normal subjects were analyzed, and the differentially expressed miRNAs were screened and bioinformatically analyzed to derive the relevant theoretical basis and targets for subsequent studies."
