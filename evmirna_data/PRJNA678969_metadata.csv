EV isolation was performed following an initial centrifugation step of the conditioned media at 2000g to remove cellular debris followed by filtration through a 0.22 um filter. Resulting supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation of 1 h at 120 000g followed by a second ultracentrifugation of 1 h at 120 000g after washing the pellet with PBS. Analyses of vesicle size were performed by Nanoparticle-tracking assays (Nanosight). Labelling of EVs was performed with PKH26 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s directions.

Curr Protoc Cell Biol 2006;Chapter 3:Unit 3.22.",miRNA content from human and mouse epicardial extracellular vesicles,"The goal of the present study is to determine the miRNA cargo present in epicardial extracellular vesicles. For that, epicardial cells and human primary epicardial cells were cultured. Conditioned media was isolated from mouse epicardial cells and human primary epicardial cells derived from right atrial appendages in two different states: “cobble” (inactive) cells and “spindle” (active) . RNA from EVs was isolated and sequenced to determine the miRNA content profile.
Overall design: Examination on miRNA content in epicardial Evs"
