PRJNA1037332,SRR26749153,-,Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)|Primary cell,-,-,2023-12-18,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1037332/,-,The microRNA profile of CAF derived exosomes under hypoxic and normoxic conditions.,"Hypoxia commonly occurs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) during rapid tumor growth. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the predominant cells in the TME. These CAFs are known to influence the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) via exosomes, with microRNAs being the principal non-coding RNAs present in these exosomes. In this project, we aim to investigate the specific microRNAs from CAFs that impact PCa progression in a hypoxic environment."
