PRJNA834825,SRR19070245,sEV,Blood,Healthy donor,-,2022-06-01,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35789846/,"Exosomes were collected from the M2 macrophage culture spent medium by ultrafiltration as reported previously (Lane et al., 2017; Théry et al., 2018). Briefly, the cultured supernatants were collected, and the exosomes were purified by sequential centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, followed by 2000 × g for 30 min at 4°C to remove the cells and cellular debris. Next, the supernatants were filtered through a 0·22 μm filter membrane (Cat# SLGP033RB, Millipore, MA, USA) to remove large vesicles. The supernatants mainly containing the exosomes were further concentrated to 150 μL by Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter (Cat# UFC910096, Millipore, MA, USA), followed by washing with PBS twice.",Exosomal microRNA expression profiles of NASH: normal vs. NASH (human),"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a predominant form of chronic liver disease, affecting nearly 25 % of the global population. The progression from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in NAFLD patients is one of the major causes of liver-related death worldwide. We assessed the miRNA expression profiles of the exosomes derived from the peripheral blood of NASH patients or healthy controls.
Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for exosomes derived from the peripheral blood of NASH patients or healthy controls."
