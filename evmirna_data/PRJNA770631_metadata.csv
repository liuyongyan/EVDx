In the present study, we aim to describe differential expressed plasma exosome-miRNAs in patients with post-STEMI 3-6 months. Methods: Consecutive patients with ages from 40 to 80 years and 25 males among them 3-6 months after STEMI (n=11) were compared to sex-matched healthy control (n=10). The mean age of the patient was 64.71±10.40 years and 89.2% were male. Compared to the healthy control group, the plasma exosome-miRNAs were assessed by using microarray assay (IIIumnia Hiseq 2500). Profile of plasma exosome-miRNAs related to heart diseases was established both in the patient and control groups. The specificity of the lowest expressed exosome-miRNAs for all subjects was evaluated by using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain (qPCR).

The morphology of the exosome was visualized with transmission electron microscopy (Hitachi, #HT-7700) at 100 kV. Nanoparticles were detected by high-sensitivity flow cytometry (NanoFCM N30E). Exosome (10 μl) was diluted to 30 μl for aspiration, with attention focused on the need for gradient dilution to avoid sample clogging of the injection needle.",Plasma exosomes miRNAs high-throughput sequencing in patients after STEMI 3-6 months (human),"ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) is one of the most severe forms of cardiovascular heart diseases. In the present study, we aim to describe differential expressed plasma exosome-miRNAs in patients with post-STEMI 3-6 months. Methods: Consecutive patients with ages from 40 to 80 years and 25 males among them 3-6 months after STEMI (n=11) were compared to sex-matched healthy control (n=10). The mean age of the patient was 64.71±10.40 years and 89.2% were male. Compared to the healthy control group, the plasma exosome-miRNAs were assessed by using microarray assay (IIIumnia Hiseq 2500). Profile of plasma exosome-miRNAs related to heart diseases was established both in the patient and control groups. The specificity of the lowest expressed exosome-miRNAs for all subjects was evaluated by using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain (qPCR).
