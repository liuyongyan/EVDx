To extract MSC-EVs, a combined method based on tangential flow filtration (TFF) followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used (TFF-SEC) [31]. Briefly, molecules > 100 kDa were concentrated using a tangential flow filter (HansaBioMed, Tallinn, Estonia) to a volume of 2 mL. Subsequently, the MSC-EVs contained in the medium were isolated on EV SEC columns (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). MSC-EVs were resuspended in PBS for functional analysis and characterization by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and asymmetrical flow field flow fraction (AF4).
[31] Visan KS, Lobb RJ, Ham S, Lima LG, Palma C, Edna CPZ, et al. Comparative analysis of tangential flow filtration and ultracentrifugation, both combined with subsequent size exclusion chromatography, for the isolation of small extracellular vesicles. J Extracell Vesicles. 2022;11(9):e12266.",miRNAseq of extracellular vesicles from immortalized dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells from three different biopsies (human),"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from three different biopsies of dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-EVs) were isolated and characterized by different omic analysis. The goal was to characterized the EVs cargo to study their implication in an animal model of chronic cardiac inflammation
Overall design: MSC-EVs were isolated form immortalized dental pulp MSC by tangential flow-filtration followed by size exclusion chromatography (TFF-SEC). The MSC-EVs were injected intramyocardially in a model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in nude rats, and their therapeutic effect was assessed 7 and 21 days post-infarction"
