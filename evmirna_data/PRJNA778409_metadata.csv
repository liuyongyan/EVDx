After the cell density reached 70%–80%, SCAP were washed with PBS three times and changed to EV-free medium (bovine serum EVs were removed by 16 h centrifugation at 110,000 × g). The culture medium was collected after 48 h, and the EVs were isolated at 4°C by sequential centrifugation. The collected medium was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min and then at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and EVs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g (Beckman Coulter Optima L-100 XP, SW 32 Ti) for 90 min. The EV pellet was washed in cold PBS and collected by ultracentrifugation again at 110,000×g for 90 min. Finally, the EV pellet was resuspended in PBS and stored at −80°C.",microRNA profile of extracellular vesicles derived from control vehicle- and LIPUS-induced stem cells from the apical papilla (human),"Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is shown to promote osteogenic differentiation and antiinflammation of periodontal mesenchymal stromal cells. We found extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from LIPUS-induced stem cells from apical papilla (SCAPs) also have stronger anti-inflammatory and osteogenic effects in vitro and in vivo. To obtain clues on whether microRNA (miR) of EVs contribute to stronger  anti-inflammatory and osteogenic effects, we analyzed miR expression in EVs from control- and LIPUS-induced SCAPs by deep sequencing. RNA-sequencing suggests that the LIPUS-EVs induce stronger osteogenic differentiation and antiinflammation by using their cargos, including upregulated osteogenic miRNAs to activate the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, and upregulated anti-inflammatory miRNAs to inhibit the TNF-α signaling pathways.
Overall design: EVs were isolated from control vehicle- and LIPUS-treated SCAPs (90mW/cm2, 0.5 h treatment). Equal number of EVs were subjected to microRNA analysis by deep-sequencing."
