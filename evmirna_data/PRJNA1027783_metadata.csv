PRJNA1027783,SRR26384007,sEV,Primary cell|periodontal ligament cell,-,-,2023-10-30,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37939516/,"After cyclic stretch loading, the cell culture supernatant was collected, and the exosomes were extracted by using Qiagen exoEasy Maxi Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany).",Cyclic stretch-induced exosomes from periodontal ligament cells promote osteoblasts osteogenic differentiation via the miR-181d-5p/TNF signaling pathway (human),"Objective: To investigate the effects of stretch-induced periodontal ligament cell (PDLC) exosomes on osteoblast differentiation, and to explore their regulatory role in mechanical force-related periodontal tissue remodeling.Design: After applying 20% stretch loading to human periodontal ligament cells, exosomes were extracted from the supernatant and co-cultured with osteoblasts to detect their effects on osteogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, the exosomes were sequenced by high-throughput microRNA sequencing for bioinformatic analysis and validation to explore exosome signaling pathways through miRNAs.Results: Stretch-induced PDLC exosomes could be taken up by osteoblasts and promoted osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts, as demonstrated by the increased expression levels of osteogenesis-related factors and enhanced ALP staining. In the miRNA profile of differentially expressed PDLC exosomes under stretch loading, miRNA-181d-5p was up-regulated significantly. The expression levels of osteogenesis-related factors and ALP staining were also increased in osteoblasts transfected with miR-181d-5p, and this effect might be related to the inhibitory role of exosomal miR-181d-5p on tumor necrosis factor (TNF).Conclusions: Stretch-induced PDLC exosomes exhibited a promoting effect on osteogenic differentiation, which might result from the inhibition of TNF via exosomal miR-181d-5p.
Overall design: Design: After applying 20% stretch loading to human periodontal ligament cells, exosomes were extracted from the supernatant and co-cultured with osteoblasts to detect their effects on osteogenic differentiation.
