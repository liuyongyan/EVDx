]. EVs were separated from Nor-, Hyp-, NorINF-, and HypINF- CM by differential ultracentrifugation using a Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge (Optima L-90K), according to an already published protocol [22]. After collecting the CM, cells/cell debris and apoptotic bodies were removed centrifuging the CM for 10 min at 300 xg and for 20 min at 2000 xg, respectively. The resulting supernatant was transferred into ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman-Coulter, USA) and subjected to a first centrifugation for 40 min at 10.000 xg (10K pellet) to obtain an EV pellet (10K pellet) enriched with medium sized-vesicles (mEVs). Supernatants were then centrifuged for 120 min at 100.000 xg in order to obtain a pellet (100K pellet) enriched with small sized-vesicles (sEVs). Supernatants derived from 100K centrifugation were collected as depleted media (DM) and concentrated to reach the same volume of their corresponding CM. All EV pellets were washed in PBS and centrifuged at the same speed before being resuspended in sterile filtered (0.22 μm) PBS or serum-free medium, in the same volume of their corresponding CM and DM. A SW28 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter) has been used during the ultracentrifugation steps.",Dissecting the effects of preconditioning with inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia on the angiogenic potential of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC)-derived soluble proteins and Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) (human),"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are characterized by a regulatory phenotype and respond promptly to the environmental signals modulating their secretory activity. An appropriate preconditioning may induce MSCs to release secretomes with an enhanced regenerative potential. However, it fails to take into account that secretomes are composed by both soluble factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs), whose functions could be altered differently by the preconditioning approach. Here we demonstrate that the MSC secretome is strongly modulated by the simultaneous stimulation with hypoxia and pro-inflammatory cytokines, used to mimic the harsh environment present at the site of injury. The cargo content (in terms of miRNAs) of the corresponding EV fractions was less sensitive to the influence of the external stimuli.
Overall design: miRNAseq of EVs obtained from human MSC treated in 4 different conditions. MSC are derived from 3 donors."

A SW28 swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter) has been used during the ultracentrifugation steps.",Dissecting the effects of preconditioning with inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia on the angiogenic potential of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC)-derived soluble proteins and Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) (human),"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are characterized by a regulatory phenotype and respond promptly to the environmental signals modulating their secretory activity. An appropriate preconditioning may induce MSCs to release secretomes with an enhanced regenerative potential. However, it fails to take into account that secretomes are composed by both soluble factors and extracellular vesicles (EVs), whose functions could be altered differently by the preconditioning approach. Here we demonstrate that the MSC secretome is strongly modulated by the simultaneous stimulation with hypoxia and pro-inflammatory cytokines, used to mimic the harsh environment present at the site of injury. The cargo content (in terms of miRNAs) of the corresponding EV fractions was less sensitive to the influence of the external stimuli.
Overall design: miRNAseq of EVs obtained from human MSC treated in 4 different conditions. MSC are derived from 3 donors."
