Briefly, serum (1 ml) was diluted with equal volume of PBS and centrifuged for 30 min at 2000g at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for 45 min at 12 000g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, PBS was added to bring the total volume to 20 ml, which was gently pipetted on top of 4 ml Tris/sucrose/D2O solution (30% sucrose cushion) and centrifuged for 75 min at 100000g at 4°C with an Optima L-100K ultracentrifuge using a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor. A 5 ml syringe fitted with an 18-G needle was used to collect approximately 3.5 ml of the sucrose cushion from the side of the ultracentrifuge tube. The aspirate was then transferred to a fresh ultracentrifuge tube, diluted to 60 ml with PBS, and centrifuged for 70 min at 100 000g at 4°C using a 45Ti fixed-angle rotor. The sEV pellet was resuspended in 100 μl PBS and stored at −80°C for downstream analysis.",Comprehensive microRNA-sequencing of small extracellular vesicles from early-stage HNSCC cases and cancer-free controls with benign neoplastic conditions (human),"Exosomes are nano-sized (30-150 nm), membrane encapsulated vesicles that are released by cells into the extracellular space and function as intercellular signaling vectors through the horizontal transfer of biologic molecules, including microRNA (miRNA). Although secreted by both normal and malignant cells, there is evidence that cancer-derived exosomes enable the tumor to manipulate its microenvironment, contributing to the capacity of the tumor for immune evasion, growth, invasion, and metastatic spread. The purpose of this study was to apply miRNA-sequencing to exosomes isolated from conditioned culture media to comprehensively characterize miRNA secreted in exosomes from 4 distinct head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and normal oral epithelial cells.

Briefly, serum (1 ml) was diluted with equal volume of PBS and centrifuged for 30 min at 2000g at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for 45 min at 12 000g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, PBS was added to bring the total volume to 20 ml, which was gently pipetted on top of 4 ml Tris/sucrose/D2O solution (30% sucrose cushion) and centrifuged for 75 min at 100000g at 4°C with an Optima L-100K ultracentrifuge using a 70Ti fixed-angle rotor. A 5 ml syringe fitted with an 18-G needle was used to collect approximately 3.5 ml of the sucrose cushion from the side of the ultracentrifuge tube. The aspirate was then transferred to a fresh ultracentrifuge tube, diluted to 60 ml with PBS, and centrifuged for 70 min at 100 000g at 4°C using a 45Ti fixed-angle rotor. The sEV pellet was resuspended in 100 μl PBS and stored at −80°C for downstream analysis.",Comprehensive microRNA-sequencing of small extracellular vesicles from early-stage HNSCC cases and cancer-free controls with benign neoplastic conditions (human),"Exosomes are nano-sized (30-150 nm), membrane encapsulated vesicles that are released by cells into the extracellular space and function as intercellular signaling vectors through the horizontal transfer of biologic molecules, including microRNA (miRNA). Although secreted by both normal and malignant cells, there is evidence that cancer-derived exosomes enable the tumor to manipulate its microenvironment, contributing to the capacity of the tumor for immune evasion, growth, invasion, and metastatic spread. The purpose of this study was to apply miRNA-sequencing to exosomes isolated from conditioned culture media to comprehensively characterize miRNA secreted in exosomes from 4 distinct head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines and normal oral epithelial cells.
Overall design: Case-control pilot study"
