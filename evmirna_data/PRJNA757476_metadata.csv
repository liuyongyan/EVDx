Exosomes, subtypes of extracellular vesicles comprising many bioactive factors regulate the early stages of pregnancy, specifically during embryo implantation. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) derived from placental trophoblasts regulate embryo implantation remains elusive. Herer, we isolated and identified exosomes derived from placental trophoblasts cells (HTR8/SVneo). Subsequently, we evaluated the loading miRNA in exosomes by small RNA sequencing. This study provides novel insights into the mechanism of trophoblasts cells-derived exosomes during embryo implantation.
Overall design: Three HTR8/Svneo cells and three HTR8/SVneo cells-derived exosomes samples were collected and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq. The miRNAs in cells and exosomes were mapped."
