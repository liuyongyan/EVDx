From the supernatants, EVs were extracted using the miRCURY exosome isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and total miRNA was extracted from the exosomes using a miRNA isolation kit (miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocols.",Keratinocyte-derived circulating exosomal miRNAs as a novel biomarker of disease severity in psoriasis (human),"To reveal the relationship between circulating exosomal miRNAs and the disease severity of psoriasis, we performed next-generation sequencing from plasma exosomes of patients with high psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score (>10) and low PASI score (<5).
We identified 19 differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs that were significantly different between the groups. We validated the top three up-and down-regulated exosomal miRNAs using quantitative real-time PCR.
Overall design: We performed next-generation sequencing from plasma exosomes of patients with high psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score (>10) and low PASI score (<5)
