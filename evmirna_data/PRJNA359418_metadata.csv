The resultant supernatant fluid was passed through a 0.22 μm sterile filter (Steritop™, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 120 min (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Asheville, NC, USA, Sorvall, SureSpinTM 630/36, Tube angle: 900). The pellet was resuspended in PBS (500 μl, pH 7.4), layered on the top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient containing 40% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v) and 5% (w/v) iodixanol solutions made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60% (w/v) aqueous iodixanol from Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 18 h.

Extravillous trophoblast invade the uterine arteries to remodel the SpA during the first 20 weeks of gestation. Interestingly, oxygen tenstion in the uterine environment changes with the progression of pregnancies and damage in the SpA remodelling can lead to preeclampsia and pther pregnancy complications. Recently, our understanding of how cells communicate has undergone a paradigm shift since the recognition of the role of exosomes on intercellular signaling. Here, we investigated whether oxygen tension alters the exosome release and miRNA profile from extravillous trophoblast (EVT), modifying their bioactivity on endothelial cells. Furthermore, we have established the exosomal miRNA profile at early gestation in women who develop pre-eclampsia (PE) and spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). The effect of  oxygen tension (i.e. 8% and 1% oxygen) on exosome release was quantified using nanocrystals (Qdot®) coupled to CD63 by fluorescence NTA. A real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™) was used to establish the effect of exosomes on endothelial cells. Plasma samples were obtained at early gestation (<18 weeks) and classified according to pregnancy outcomes. An Illumina TrueSeq Small RNA kit was used to construct a small RNA library from exosomal RNA obtained from EVT and plasma samples. The number of exosomes was significantly hifger in EVT culturedunder 1% compared to 8% oxygen. In total, 741 miRNA were identified in exosomes from EVT. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these miRNA were associated with cell migration and cytokine production. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from EVT cultured at 8% oxygen increased EC migration, while exosomes from 1% oxygen decrease EC migration. These changes were inversely proportional to TNF-α released from EC. Finally, we have identified a set of uniques miRNA in exosomes from EVT cultured at 1% oxygen and exosomes isolated from maternal at early gestation, who developed PE and SPTB later in pregnancy. We suggest that aberrant exosomal signalling by placental cells is a common aetiological factor in pregnancy complications characterised by incomplete SpA remodeling and is therefore a clinically useful biomarker of pregnancy complications.

Finally, we have identified a set of uniques miRNA in exosomes from EVT cultured at 1% oxygen and exosomes isolated from maternal at early gestation, who developed PE and SPTB later in pregnancy. We suggest that aberrant exosomal signalling by placental cells is a common aetiological factor in pregnancy complications characterised by incomplete SpA remodeling and is therefore a clinically useful biomarker of pregnancy complications.

Briefly, samples were centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min, 2,000 x g for 10 min, and 12,000 x g for 20 min; and, 2,000 x g for 30 min, and 12,000 x g for 45 min to remove whole cells and debris for cell-conditioned media and plasma, respectively. The resultant supernatant fluid was passed through a 0.22 μm sterile filter (Steritop™, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and then centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 120 min (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Asheville, NC, USA, Sorvall, SureSpinTM 630/36, Tube angle: 900). The pellet was resuspended in PBS (500 μl, pH 7.4), layered on the top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient containing 40% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v) and 5% (w/v) iodixanol solutions made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60% (w/v) aqueous iodixanol from Sigma-Aldrich) and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 18 h. Twelve individual fractions were collected, diluted in PBS and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 2 h. Finally, the pellet for each fraction was resuspended in 50 μl of PBS and stored at -80°C.",Homo sapiens (human),"Cell-to-cell communication is essential for the spiral artery (SpA) remodeling and required for maternal transfer of nutrient and oxygen to the fetus. Extravillous trophoblast invade the uterine arteries to remodel the SpA during the first 20 weeks of gestation. Interestingly, oxygen tenstion in the uterine environment changes with the progression of pregnancies and damage in the SpA remodelling can lead to preeclampsia and pther pregnancy complications. Recently, our understanding of how cells communicate has undergone a paradigm shift since the recognition of the role of exosomes on intercellular signaling. Here, we investigated whether oxygen tension alters the exosome release and miRNA profile from extravillous trophoblast (EVT), modifying their bioactivity on endothelial cells. Furthermore, we have established the exosomal miRNA profile at early gestation in women who develop pre-eclampsia (PE) and spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB). The effect of  oxygen tension (i.e. 8% and 1% oxygen) on exosome release was quantified using nanocrystals (Qdot®) coupled to CD63 by fluorescence NTA. A real-time, live-cell imaging system (Incucyte™) was used to establish the effect of exosomes on endothelial cells. Plasma samples were obtained at early gestation (<18 weeks) and classified according to pregnancy outcomes. An Illumina TrueSeq Small RNA kit was used to construct a small RNA library from exosomal RNA obtained from EVT and plasma samples. The number of exosomes was significantly hifger in EVT culturedunder 1% compared to 8% oxygen. In total, 741 miRNA were identified in exosomes from EVT. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that these miRNA were associated with cell migration and cytokine production. Interestingly, exosomes isolated from EVT cultured at 8% oxygen increased EC migration, while exosomes from 1% oxygen decrease EC migration. These changes were inversely proportional to TNF-α released from EC. Finally, we have identified a set of uniques miRNA in exosomes from EVT cultured at 1% oxygen and exosomes isolated from maternal at early gestation, who developed PE and SPTB later in pregnancy.
