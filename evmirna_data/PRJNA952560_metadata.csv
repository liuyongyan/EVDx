PRJNA952560,GSM7147871,sEV,Astrocyte|Primary cell,Healthy donor,-,2024-04-24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38663691/,"Astrocyte cultures for iPSC-ADEV isolation were derived from the two biological replicates of NPCs together with one technical replicate from the second NPC preparation initiated one week later. The astrocytes were washed in PBS and cultured in Advanced DMEM-F12 7.5 % EXOsome-depleted FBS (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) overnight. A volume of 12 ml of astrocyte conditioned media was harvested from one 6 well plate and residual cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 300 ×g followed by 1200 ×g both for 10 min at room temperature. Supernatant was filtered using 0.20 μm cellulose filter (Corning, NY) and kept frozen at −20 °C until ultracentrifugation. ADEV isolation was performed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 14 h at 4 °C (swing bucket rotor on minimum acceleration/brake setting, SW 32Ti Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA), and ADEVs were resuspended in 200 μl PBS and stored at −20 °C until used ( Antounians et al., 2019; Antounians et al., 2021 ).",iPSC-derived healthy human astrocytes selectively load miRNAs   targeting neuronal genes into extracellular vesicles (human),"We performed RNA-seq on human iPSC derived astrocytes and iPSC derived astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles.
Overall design: RNA-seq of PGPC14WT astrocyte differentiations, primary human commercial astrocytes, and astrocyte derived extracellular vesicles."
