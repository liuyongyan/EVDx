PRJNA761419,SRR15744311,sEV,Primary cell|Schwann cell,-,-,2022-02-15,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35174212/,"Exosomes were isolated from the supernatant of a rat Schwann cell line (RSC96) using a previous protocol (Cosenza et al., 2018). When RSC96s reached 80–90% confluence, they were grown in exosome-free culture medium, which consisted of 10% exosome-free FBS (Serapro, USA) obtained by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g for 12 h. The supernatants were collected and initially centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min to remove dead cells and later centrifuged at 4000 g for 30 min to remove cell debris. Subsequently, the supernatants were centrifuged at 120,000 g for 70 min and 120,000 g for 60 min at 4°C. The pellets were resuspended in PBS and stored at −80°C.",MiRNA sequencing of Schwann-like cells induced by Schwann cell-derived exosomes (human),"Background: Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) can differentiate into Schwann cells (SCs) at the site of nerve injury, where Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SC-Exos) are suspected to exert an induction effect. Our study aimed to induce the differentiation of ADSCs in vitro using SC-Exos and to investigate the mechanisms involved through miRNA sequencing.  Methods: Subcutaneous fat was used to extract ADSCs. Exosomes were extracted from Schwann cell lines (RSC96) using ultracentrifugation. After 8 days of induction of ADSCs by SC-Exos, phenotypic characteristics were observed by examining the expression of SC markers (S100, NGFR, MPZ, GFAP) through RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Additionally, miRNA sequencing was performed on induced ADSCs, followed by bioinformatic analysis and validation of the results.  Results: SC-Exos were taken up by human ADSCs. The RNA and protein expression levels of S100, NGFR, MPZ and GFAP were found to be significantly higher in the SC-Exo induction group than in the uninduced group, despite no significant difference to the Dezawa’s method group, which was also consistent with the immunofluorescence results. According to the sequencing results, there were a total of 72 differentially expressed miRNAs. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that 3506 Gene Ontology terms and 98 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were significantly enriched. Ten miRNAs, 6 target mRNAs and elevated expression of the PIK3CD/Akt pathway were validated by RT-qPCR or Western blot, which is consistent with the sequencing results.  Conclusions: Our data suggest that SC-Exos are able to induce the differentiation of ADSCs into SCs in vitro. It is speculated that the differentially expressed miRNAs play a significant role in the differentiation process.
