After 24 h, the media were collected for EV isolation, initiating the process with sequential centrifugation in three steps: ×400 g, ×4,000 g and ×10,000 g for 10 min each at 4°C. The supernatant obtained from the preceding step was utilized for each subsequent centrifugation. Subsequently, the supernatant obtained after the final centrifugation step was concentrated to a final volume of 500 µL using Amicon® Ultra15 centrifugal filters with a 10 kDa cutoff. EV isolation was performed by employing size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in a 10 cm column containing a cross-linked 4% agarose matrix of 90 μm beads (Sepharose 4 fast flow™, GE HealthCare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (Midekessa et al., 2020).",Homo sapiens (human),Background:
