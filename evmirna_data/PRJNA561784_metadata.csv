PRJNA561784,SRR10029319,sEV,Lung|Lung spheroid cells|Primary cell,-,-,2019-11-21,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32111836/,"Exosomes were collected and purified from human LSC-Sec and MSC-Sec using an ultrafiltration method52. The secretomes were first filtered through a 0.22 μm filter to remove any cells or cell debris. The filtered secretomes were then placed in a 100 kDa MWCO ultrafiltration filter (Millipore) and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 10–15 min depending on volume. Any media contents or small proteins were removed by the filtered centrifugation, and the remaining exosomes were suspended in PBS, then filtered and washed. Before use, all exosome samples were analyzed for proper size by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA; NanoSight, Malvern), and for morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",Inhalation of Lung Spheroid Cell-Secreted Factors and Exosomes Promotes Therapeutic Lung Repair in Rodent Models of Pulmonary Fibrosis (human),"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal form of interstitial lung disease in which persistent injury results in scar tissue formation. As fibrosis thickens, the lung tissue becomes stiff and losses the ability to facilitate gas exchange and provide cells with needed oxygen. Currently, IPF has few treatment options and no effective therapies, aside from lung transplant. Here we present a series of studies utilizing lung spheroid cell-derived conditioned media (LSC-CM) and exosomes (LSC-EXO) to treat different rodent models of lung injury and fibrosis. Inhalation treatment was given for seven consecutive days via a nebulizer for clinical relevance. Results revealed that LSC-CM and LSC-EXO treatments could attenuate and resolve bleomycin- and silica-induced fibrosis by reestablishing normal alveolar structure, decreasing collagen accumulation, and myofibroblast proliferation. In addition, LSC-CM and LSC-EXOs exhibited superior therapeutic benefits than their counterparts derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. LSC-CM and LSC-EXOs provide promising therapeutic options for pulmonary fibrosis.
Overall design: Exosomes were collected and purified from human lung spheroid cells (LSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their small RNAs were sequenced on a Nextseq500 sequencer (Illumina) using 45bp single-end reads."
