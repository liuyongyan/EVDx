Following a recommended 2–3-day abstinence period, fresh ejaculate semen samples were collected in a sterile plastic cup. A two-step (40% and 80%) gradient fractionation method was used to separate sperm from semen (Wu, De Gannes, Luchetti, & Pilsner, 2015) and the resulting seminal plasma was stored at −80 °C in aliquots until subsequent analysis. To isolate spEV total RNA, frozen seminal plasma samples were thawed for 20 min at room temperature. Isolation of EVs and total RNA was performed using standard commercially available Qiagen exoRNAeasy Midi Kit (Cat. #77144) with according to the manufacturer's protocol (Enderle et al., 2015). Briefly, an equal volume of PBS and seminal plasma were mixed and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 45 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were carefully removed and filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane (Whatman PURADISC 25, cat.#6780–2505). The filtrate was mixed with one volume of DNA binding buffer (XBP) and centrifuged at 500 g for 3 min in an exoEasy spin column. To wash off non-EV materials, 3.5 mL of XWP buffer was added to the column and centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min. ",Altered non-coding RNA profiles of seminal plasma extracellular vesicles of men with poor semen quality undergoing In Vitro fertilization treatment (human),"EVs are known to contain important cargo of biologically active and regulatory molecules including ncRNAs. EVs in seminal plasma, play an important role in sperm functions , including motility and fertilization. However, less is known about the comprehensive profile of spEV ncRNAs in clinical cohort and if these profiles differ by semen quality status.
We assessed sperm-free spEV ncRNA profiles from semen samples of male partners receiving IVF treatment. Men were classified into having normal (n = 59, Status 0)  or poor (n = 32, Status 1) semen quality based on WHO semen parameter guidelines.
Overall design: Small RNA-seq reads were mapped to standard biotype-specific transcriptomes in the order miRNA>tRNA>piRNA>rRNA> “other” RNA>circRNA>lncRNA using STAR. Differential expression of normalized ncRNA read counts between groups was conducted by EdgeR (Fold change ≥1.5 & FDR<0.05)"
