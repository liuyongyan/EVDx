The pellet was washed with 12.5 mL of PBS and followed by a second UC at 100,000g for 2 h at 4°C. Afterward, the supernatant was discarded and exosomes were resuspended in 50–100 μL PBS.","Integration of miRNA in exosomes and single-cell RNA-seq profiles in endemic osteoarthritis, Kashin-Beck disease (human)","Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is an endemic, chronic degenerative joint disease in China. Exosomes miRNAs, as signaling molecules in intercellular communication, can transfer specific biological martials into target cell to regulate the their function and might participate in the pathogenesis of KBD. We isolated serum and chondrocytes-derived exosomes, miRNA sequencing revealed exosomes miRNA profiles and differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were identified. The target genes were predicted of known and novel DE-miRNAs with TargetScan 5.0 and miRanda 3.3a database. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed to identify chondrocyte clusters and their gene signatures in KBD. And we performed comparative analysis between the serum and chondrocytes-derived exosomes DE-miRNA target genes and differentially expressed genes of each cell clusters.A total of 20 DE-miRNAs were identified in serum-derived exosomes. In the miRNA expression of chondrocytes-derived exosomes, 53 DE-miRNAs were identified. 16063 predicted targets were identified as the target genes in the serum-derived exosomes, 57316 predicted targets were identified as the target genes in the chondrocytes-derived exosomes. Seven clusters were labelled by cell type according to the expression of previously described markers. 315 common genes were found among serum/chondrocytes-derived exosomes DE-miRNA target genes and DEGs identified by scRNA-seq analysis. We firstly integratly analyzed the serum and chondrocytes exosomes miRNA with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of KBD chondrocyte, the results showed that DE-miRNAs in exosomes might play a potential role in regulating genes expression in different KBD chondrocytes clusters by exosomes mediating cell-cell communications functions, which could improve the new diagnosis and treatment methods for KBD.
