The upper serum was carefully collected and filtrated with a 0.22 μm needle filter for the next step. For the preparation of RA or Trauma FLSs derived EVs, the FLSs were incubated with EVs depleted FBS for 72 h. The supernatants were centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min, and another 3000 g for 20 min at 4°C to remove any cells and debris. Next, the supernatants were filtrated with 0.8 µm filter and then a Millipore 100 kD ultrafiltration tube to concentrate the supernatants. The EVs were extracted using QIAGEN’s commercialized exoEasy Maxi Kit (Cat.No.76064). The isolated EVs can be directly used for identification, while for the functional experiments, the EVs was eluted twice with PBS in Millipore 100 kD ultrafiltration tube.",Human Fibroblast-Like Synoviocytes Derived Extracellular Vesicles miRNA sequencing (human),"Purpose:The goal of this study is to compare the miRNA expressions in LPS stimulated RA FLSs derived EVs between trauma FLSs derived EVs.
Methods:Total RNA of EVs was extracted with trizol LS (Invitrogen, USA), and quantified with Nanodrop. Agarose electrophoresis was used for quality inspection, and library was constructed after passing the quality inspection. Then, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used to determine the quality of the library. RNA was denatured with 0.1 M NaOH and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq500.
Results:In total of 24 miRNAs were changed in the 650 scanned miRNAs in LPS stimulated RA FLSs derived EVs, compared to Trauma FLSs derived EVs, with 13 up-regulated miRNAs and 11 down-regulated miRNAs(P<0.05; Fold change>=1.5).Next, we analyzed the possible biological functions of the expression changed miRNAs using GO analysis. Of note, the results showed that expression altered miRNAs may principally correlate with blood vessel morphogenesis, cardiovascular system development, vasculature development and tube development.
Conclusions:RNA parts of LPS-RA FLSs derived EVs may play key role in stimulating angiogenesis of ECs.
Overall design: Examination of the different microRNA in 2 FLSs  derived extracellular vesicles."
