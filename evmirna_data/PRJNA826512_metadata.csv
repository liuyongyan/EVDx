Overall design: We tested an equimolar mixture containing three PFAS compounds: PFHxA, PFOA, and PFOS; with each individual chemical at a concentration of 35uM. This PFAS mixture was used to treat HepG2 cells with a 24 hour time-point. Media was subsequently collected and used to isolate extracellular vesicles, enriching for exosomes. MicroRNA was extracted from isolated exosomes and sequenced to evaluate changes in expression associated with exposure."
