However, whether Fn can alter the expression profile of miRNAs in normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs)-derived exosomes and thus regulate the development of UC is unknown. Differentially expressed miRNAs in Fn-infected IECs-derived exosomes (Fn-Exo) and non-infected IECs-derived exosomes (Con-Exo) were identified by miRNA sequencing."
