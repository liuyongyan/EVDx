The plasma samples were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and centrifuged at 20–30 °C at 10000 g for 30 min to eliminate residual cell fragments. The plasma EVs were extracted and purified using the plasma exosome extraction and purification kit (Cat. No. EZB-exo1, EZBioscience, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Exosome Isolation Kit (from cell culture media; Cat. No. EZB-exo2, EZBioscience) was used to extract and purify the cell culture media EVs according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cell lines were cultured with depleted fetal bovine serum (FBS) media for 24 h. 20 mL cell culture media were harvested and centrifugated at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cells and debris. Cell-free culture media were transferred to a new tube and added 5 mL Exosome Precipitation Reagent (EPR). The culture media/reagent mixture were incubated at 2–8 °C overnight. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 10000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, appropriate 1 × PBS resuspend the EVs. The exosomes from culture media were identified by transmission electron microscopy.",Discovery of extracellular vesicles derived miR-185-5p in patient’s plasma as an indicator for advanced adenoma and malignant tumor of colon (human),"We attempted to screen and identify new plasma EV delivered microRNA can simultaneously diagnose AA, early CRC and advanced CRC in healthy people. We employed microRNA deep sequencing assay for the primary screen and performed TaqMan microRNA assay for further test and validation. Through stepwise screen and validation in two independent cohorts (cohort I: n=75, cohort II: n=104), we demonstrated that plasma EV-delivered miR-185-5p is a potential indicator of AA and CRC in Chinese patients. In the supplementary phase, we also preliminarily proved that miR-185-5p can promote the development of CRC in vivo and in vitro.
Overall design: Comparative miRNA expression profiling analysis of miRNA-seq data for plasma extracellular vesicles in healthy donor, advanced adenoma, and colorectal cancer patients."

The plasma samples were thawed in a 37 °C water bath and centrifuged at 20–30 °C at 10000 g for 30 min to eliminate residual cell fragments. The plasma EVs were extracted and purified using the plasma exosome extraction and purification kit (Cat. No. EZB-exo1, EZBioscience, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Exosome Isolation Kit (from cell culture media; Cat. No. EZB-exo2, EZBioscience) was used to extract and purify the cell culture media EVs according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cell lines were cultured with depleted fetal bovine serum (FBS) media for 24 h. 20 mL cell culture media were harvested and centrifugated at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cells and debris. Cell-free culture media were transferred to a new tube and added 5 mL Exosome Precipitation Reagent (EPR). The culture media/reagent mixture were incubated at 2–8 °C overnight. After incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 10000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, appropriate 1 × PBS resuspend the EVs. The exosomes from culture media were identified by transmission electron microscopy.",Discovery of extracellular vesicles derived miR-185-5p in patient’s plasma as an indicator for advanced adenoma and malignant tumor of colon (human),"We attempted to screen and identify new plasma EV delivered microRNA can simultaneously diagnose AA, early CRC and advanced CRC in healthy people.
