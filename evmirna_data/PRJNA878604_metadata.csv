Briefly, the serum samples were passed through a filter (0.8 μm pore size, product no.: SLAA033SB; Millipore, Burlington, Massachusetts, United States) to exclude large particles. An equivalent volume of kit buffer XBP was then added to 500 μl of the sample, followed by five inversions. The mixture was then added to an exoEasy spin column and centrifuged at 500 g for 1 min at room temperature. After the flow-through was discarded, 10 ml of buffer XWP was added to the column and centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min to remove residual buffer in the column. The column was then transferred to a fresh collection tube, 400 μl of buffer XE was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 min. The collection tube was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min to collect the eluate.",Serum exosomal miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic of migraine patients treated with acupuncture,"Migraine is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by attacks of moderate-to-severe headaches and various neurological symptoms. The diagnosis and relief of migraine are solely by self-reported clinical symptoms. We conducted this study to identify diagnostic biomarkers which helped to differentiate migraine without aura (MWoA) patients from healthy controls (HC) and identify prognostic biomarkers which helped to predict the effect of acupuncture. We isolated the exosomes from the serum of 20 MWoA patients and 10 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The MWoA patients were treated with true acupuncture group (trAMWoA) and sham acupuncture group (shAMWoA). After the exosomes were characterized and total RNA was isolated, small RNA sequencing was performed for the exosomes."
