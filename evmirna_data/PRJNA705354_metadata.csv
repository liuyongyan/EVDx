The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris and filtered using a 0.22 μm filter (StericupTM Quick Release DuraporeTM, Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). The filtered supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 210,000 g for 70 min at 4 °C using Optima XL-100K (Beckman Coulter, Inc, Brea, CA, USA) in a swing rotor SW41Ti (Beckman Coulter, Inc). The residual fraction was washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and again collected by ultracentrifugation at 210,000 g. PBS was added to the final sEV-enriched fraction.",Small extracellular vesicles derived from interferon-γ pre-conditioned mesenchymal stromal cell(MSC)s effectively treat liver fibrosis (human),"A novel therapeutic approach of IFN-γ-treated mesenchymal stromal cell-produced extracellular vesicles effectively treated a cirrhosis model.
Overall design: the miRNAs of small extracellular vesicles derived from MSCs (sEVs) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) pre-conditioned MSCs (γ-sEVs)"
