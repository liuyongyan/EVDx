Exosomes were isolated from 1 ml cell-free culture supernatant using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 500 µl of exosome isolation reagent was thoroughly mixed with 1 ml of cell-free supernatant and then incubated for 16 hr at 4°C. The reagent-supernatant mix was then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 hr to pellet the exosomes. This method results the concentration of exosomes, however a small amount of other non-exosomal contaminants and protein aggregates may also be present (Zeringer et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017), the latter of which is removed during the RNA isolation process. The supernatant was discarded and exosomal RNA immediately extracted by adding the lysis buffer directly to the exosome pellet.",MicroRNA sequencing of stem cell-derived neural culture infected with lyssavirus,Cellular and exosome miRNA profiling to examine the host miRNA response to lyssavirus (rabies) infection in a stem cell-derived neural model.

Exosomes were isolated from 1 ml cell-free culture supernatant using Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 500 µl of exosome isolation reagent was thoroughly mixed with 1 ml of cell-free supernatant and then incubated for 16 hr at 4°C. The reagent-supernatant mix was then centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 1 hr to pellet the exosomes. This method results the concentration of exosomes, however a small amount of other non-exosomal contaminants and protein aggregates may also be present (Zeringer et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017), the latter of which is removed during the RNA isolation process. The supernatant was discarded and exosomal RNA immediately extracted by adding the lysis buffer directly to the exosome pellet.",MicroRNA sequencing of stem cell-derived neural culture infected with lyssavirus,Cellular and exosome miRNA profiling to examine the host miRNA response to lyssavirus (rabies) infection in a stem cell-derived neural model. This provides insights into the molecular pathways of rabies pathogenesis and putatative biomarkers for rabies identification.
