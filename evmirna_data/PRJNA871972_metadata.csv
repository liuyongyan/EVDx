Then, the culture medium was collected without ADSCs and centrifuged at 300×g for 10 min, 3000×g for 10 min, 10,000×g for 30 min, and 100,000×g for 2 h to isolate the exosomes. ",miRNA-Seq of human urine-derived stem cell-derived exosomes in normoxia and hypoxia,"Urine-derived stem cells (USCs) and its exosomes have been proved to play an active role in the repair of tissue injury, even in renal disease. We determined whether exosomes from urine-derived stem cell-derived exosomes (USC-Exos) have characteristics of anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrosis and anti-ER stress, investigate their potential uses for CKD and AKI. We confirmed that USC-Exos promote cell proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and morphological recovery of renal pelvis, inhibit inflammation, fibrosis and ER stress. Through further analysis of high-throughput sequencing results, 7 therapeutic miRNAs have been identified. We believed that miR-122-5p, miR-26a, miR-30, miR-10a, miR-10b, let-7a and miR-200b belong to therapeutic miRNAs in renal disease. Among them, miR-122-5p was the most enriched miRNA. Furthermore, by screening DE-miRNAs under different treatments of normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and identifying exosomal-miRNAs that inhibit ER stress."
