PRJNA701976,SRR13716319,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Healthy donor,-,2022-01-02,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA701976/,-,Analysis of exosomal miRNA in plasma of patients with metastatic and non-metastatic pancreatic cancer (human),"Purpose: Analysis of exosomal miRNA in plasma of patients with metastatic and non-metastatic pancreatic cancer. To identify exosomes cargo specific miRNAs promoting cancer metastasis.
Methods: We divide the plasma samples into five groups according to whether they have metastasis and undergo surgery.The five groups are Health(20),Metastasis Pre-operation and Post-operation (14),Non-metastasis Pre-operation and Post-operation(9).Then we collected the exosomes by ultracentrifugation and extracted the small RNA in each sample.Then, we analyzed the expression changes of miRNA by small RNA sequencing.
Result: Different groups have different expression of small RNA. Compared with the non-metastatic group, the expression of miR-92a-3p , miR-148-3p and miR-25-3p increased in the metastatic group.
Conclusion:Exosomal miRNA in pancreatic cancer patient derived plasma were analyze using Hiseq2500 sequencing technique. We identified that miR-92a-3p, miR-148-3p and miR-25-3p enriched in metastatic pancreatic cancer patient plasma derived exosomes.
Overall design: Based on the analysis of exosomal miRNA in plasma samples from 5 different groups to identify the specific exosomal miRNA promoting metastasis."
