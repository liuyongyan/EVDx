Briefly, the medium was centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min and the supernatant was incubated with the exosome precipitation solution at 4 °C overnight. After subsequent centrifugation at 1500 g for 30 min, the pellet was resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Size distribution of the isolated exosomes was analyzed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) using NanoSight NS300 (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK). BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23227, Waltham, MA, USA) was used for quantification of exosomes.",microRNA profiling of exosomes derived from human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells under PDGF stimulation (human),"Analysis of exosomal microRNAs secreted by PDGF-stimulated human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. Results increase our understanding of exosome-mediated crosstalk between vascular cells under a pathological condition.
Overall design: microRNA expression profiles of exosomes secreted by human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells after exposure to PDGF-BB by Illumina Hi-seq 2000."
