Extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated from 1ml of plasma by using polymer-based precipitation (EXOQ5TM-1, System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, plasma samples were centrifuged at 3000xg for 15 minutes to remove cells and the rest of the cellular debris. The supernatant was collected, incubated with thrombin (final concentration of 5U/ml) for 5 minutes at room temperature to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin which precipitated, and was centrifuged off at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant, containing EVs, was incubated with ExoQuick exosome precipitation solution for 1h at 4°C (pre-optimized conditions). This incubated solution was centrifuged at 1500xg for 30 minutes, and the obtained supernatant was aspirated and saved for analysis (serving as the negative control), and the pellet containing the precipitated EVs was resuspended in PBS.",Circulating extracellular vesicles exhibit a differential miRNA profile in gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancies (human),"We have reported differntial abundance of miRNAs present in the secretory Extracellular vesicles during Gestetional Diabetes Mellitus or Ischemic placental disease
Overall design: miRNAs were extracted from secretory Extracellular Vesicles isolated from maternal blood samples collected at different trimesters of pregnency. miRNA libraries were prepared, sequenced and analysed to identify the differential abundance during various pregnancy complications."

The supernatant was collected, incubated with thrombin (final concentration of 5U/ml) for 5 minutes at room temperature to catalyze the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin which precipitated, and was centrifuged off at 10,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant, containing EVs, was incubated with ExoQuick exosome precipitation solution for 1h at 4°C (pre-optimized conditions). This incubated solution was centrifuged at 1500xg for 30 minutes, and the obtained supernatant was aspirated and saved for analysis (serving as the negative control), and the pellet containing the precipitated EVs was resuspended in PBS.",Circulating extracellular vesicles exhibit a differential miRNA profile in gestational diabetes mellitus pregnancies (human),"We have reported differntial abundance of miRNAs present in the secretory Extracellular vesicles during Gestetional Diabetes Mellitus or Ischemic placental disease
Overall design: miRNAs were extracted from secretory Extracellular Vesicles isolated from maternal blood samples collected at different trimesters of pregnency. miRNA libraries were prepared, sequenced and analysed to identify the differential abundance during various pregnancy complications."
