Then the medium was replaced with exosome-depleted medium (RPMI1640 containing 10% exosome-depleted FBS). Two days later, the conditioned medium (approximately 15 ml) was collected from each dish and subjected to polymerization precipitation, ultrafiltration, and ultracentrifugation to harvest exosomes. Briefly, the conditioned medium was successively centrifuged at 1,00 × g for 10 min, 2,000 × g for 10 min, and 18,000 × g for 30 min to remove cell fragments, cell debris, and large extracellular vesicles (lEVs). The supernatant was then concentrated using an ultrafiltration tube (Merck Millipore) to < 3 mL (4,000 × g, 4 °C) to separate the exosome fraction from the soluble exosome fraction. Exosomes were then purified according to the experimental protocol of Total Exosome Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen; 4,478,359). The pellet was resuspended in particle-free PBS or stored at -80 °C in the refrigerator for subsequent use. For exosome purification from plasma, blood samples must be successively centrifuged at 150 g for 15 min and 1,200 g for 15 min to obtain PPP (platelet-poor plasma). The separation and concentration of exosomes in PPP were then similar to that of the cell-conditioned medium.
