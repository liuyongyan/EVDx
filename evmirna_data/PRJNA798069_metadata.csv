The plasma sEVs were separated by SEC with slight modifications (Boing et al., 2014). Briefly, 1 mL of the 0.8-μm membrane-filtered plasma samples was overlaid on Exosupur® columns (Echobiotech, China). The columns were further eluted using PBS, and a total amount of 2 mL from eluting fractions was collected in consistent with the manufacturer’s instructions.

In the present study, we aimed to identify serum small extracellular  vesicles (sEVs) derived microRNAs (miRNAs) from the serum samples of children  for predicting the prognosis in patients with epilepsy and drug-resistant epilepsy
Overall design: Expression of circulating miRNAs  from serum sEVs between epileptic children and healthy  children was assessed in this multiphase case-control study."
