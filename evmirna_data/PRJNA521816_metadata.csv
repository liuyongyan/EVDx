PRJNA521816,SRR8560004,sEV,Breast|Cell line|Cell line/MDA-MB-231,Breast cancer,-,2019-03-07,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31118200/,"EVs secreted by cultured cells were prepared as previously reported [5, 7]. Conditioned medium was first prepared by incubating cells grown at subconfluence in growth media containing EV-depleted FBS or horse serum (prepared by overnight ultracentrifugation of medium-diluted sera at 100,000 × g at 4°C) for 48 hours, and precleared by centrifugation at 500 × g for 15 minutes and then at 10,000 × g for 20 minutes. EVs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 70 minutes, and washed in PBS under the same ultracentrifugation conditions.

Nat Cell Biol 2018;20:597–609.","Small RNA sequencing of extracellular vesicles from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with PBS, docetaxel (DTX), or doxorubicin (DOXO) (human)","To identify the extracellular-vesicle-encapsulated miRNAs that are differentially secreted by the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells following treatment with chemotherapy drugs, we profiled the small RNAs (between 17 and 52 nt) isolated from extracellular vesicles by Illumina sequencing.  miRNAs that are significantly induced by chemotherapy drugs are identified.
Overall design: Extracellular vesicles were collected by ultracentrifugation of the conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231 cells that had been treated with docetaxel (DTX; 4 nM), doxorubicin (DOXO; 125 nM), or PBS for 48 h.  RNA was extracted using TRIZOL LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and subjected to library construction and Illumina sequencing."
