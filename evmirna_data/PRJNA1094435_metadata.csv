Then the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco´s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; BioWhittaker®, USA) and cultured for 24 h in a serum-free medium under hypoxic (1% O2) or normoxic (21% O2) conditions. The EVs were isolated by differential centrifugation according to Théry et al. 3 with minor modifications. The conditioned medium was collected and cleared from intact cells, debris, and big-sized EVs by two rounds of centrifugation at 2,000 x g, and 10,000 x g for 20 and 40 min, respectively. Subsequently, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged (Optima XE-90 Ultracentrifuge, Beckman Coulter®, USA) at 110,000 xg for 120 min, resuspended in 0.22 μm filtered, ice-cold PBS, and re-centrifuged at 110,000 g for 120 min. All centrifugation steps were performed at 4°C.",miRNA Sequencing Small Extracellular Vesicles,miRNA seq of small extracellular vesicles.
