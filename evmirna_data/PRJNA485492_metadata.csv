PRJNA485492,SRR7669367,sEV,Breast milk,-,-,2018-09-25,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30280098/,"Milk EVs were isolated as previously described [7, 9]. Fresh human milk from a pool of four breast-feeding mothers 3 until 9 months after delivery was obtained after informed consent of the donors and approval by the local ethics committee. Raw milk was centrifuged twice at 3,000 × g (Beckman Coulter Allegra X-12R, Fullerton, CA) and the milk supernatant was subjected to differential centrifugation at 5,000 × g and 10,000 × g in sterilized and new SW40 tubes (Beckman Coulter). The 10,000 × g supernatant was loaded onto a sucrose gradient (ranging from 2.0 to 0.4 M sucrose) and ultracentrifuged at 192,000 × g (in a Beckman Coulter Optima L-90K with a SW40 rotor) for 15–18 h (k-factor 144.5). EV-containing fractions (1.12–1.18 g/ml) were harvested, pooled, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 65 min. After centrifugation, supernatant was removed and EV pellets were aliquoted and stored at 80°C.

Comprehensive proteomic analysis of human milk-derived extracellular vesicles unveils a novel functional proteome distinct from other milk components. Mol Cell Proteomics (2016) 15:3412–23.",Abundantly present miRNAs in milk-derived extracellular vesicles are conserved between mammals,"Mammalian milk is not only a source of nutrition for the newborn, but also contains various components that regulate further development. For instance, milk is an abundant source of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are evolutionary conserved small non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNA. MiRNAs present in milk can occur in extracellular vesicles (EV), which are nanosized membrane vesicles released by many cell types as a means of intercellular communication. The membrane of EV protects enclosed miRNAs from degradation and harbors molecules that allow specific targeting to recipient cells. Although several studies have investigated the miRNA content in milk EV from individual species, little is known about the evolutionary conserved nature of EV-associated miRNAs among different species. In this study, we profiled the miRNA content of purified EV from human and porcine milk. These data were compared to published studies on EV from human, cow, porcine and panda milk to assess the overlap in the top 20 most abundant miRNAs.   Interestingly, several abundant miRNAs were shared between species (e.g. let-7 family members let-7a, let-7b, let-7f, and miR-148a). Moreover, these miRNAs have been implicated in immune-related functions and regulation of cell growth and signal transduction.   The conservation of these miRNA among species, not only in their sequence homology , but also in their incorporation in milk EV of several species, suggests that they are evolutionarily selected to regulate cell function in the newborn.
Overall design: EV were purified from a pool of 4 human milk donors, and from the milk of two pigs. RNA was isolated from these EV, treated with DNAse and subjected to NebNext (human) or TruSeq (pig) library preparation."
