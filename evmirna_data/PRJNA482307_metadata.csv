To purify serum exosomal RNA, 50 μl of serum exosomes was precipitated by adding 75 μl of DPBS and 32 μl of ExoQuick™ exosome precipitation solution (System Biosciences, Inc., Mountain View, CA) for 2 hr at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 12,000g for 10 min at 4°C. All purified exosomes were solubilized in DPBS for functional characterization, RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH = 8; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) for protein extraction and TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for RNA analysis.",Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes secreted from human colon cancer stem cells. (human),"As accumulating evidence suggests cancer cells exhibit stem-like properties for advanced diseases and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in various tumor types, revisiting present knowledge toward CSCs is essential.  The identification of exosome-loaded miRNAs responsible for stemness and chemoradioresistance of CSCs should eventually leadd to development of novel therapeutic approaches.
Overall design: Expression profiles of miRNAs of purified exosomes from parental HCT15/29 cells and HCT15/29-derived cancer spheres were generated for identifying central miRNAs for CSC malignancy."
