However, analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, we found that there were 149 differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes between vector and GOLPH3 over-expression groups and there were 14 miRNAs only examined in GOLPH3 over-expression cells. The predicted target genes of these miRNAs had functions in binding, catalytic activity, molecular transducer activity and transporter activity and enriched in the pathway of endocytosis, RNA transportation, thyroid hormone signaling and miRNAs in cancer."
