Small non-coding RNA sequencing from EVs showed that the profile of miRNA expression in PSC follow the profile reported for cell derived miRNA; further, most abundant miRNAs were found to originate from specific miRNA families which are regulating pluripotency, reprograming and differentiation (miR-17–92, mir-200, miR-302/367, miR-371/373, CM19 microRNA cluster). For the AT-MSCs, the highly expressed miRNAs were found to be regulating osteogenesis (mir-let-7/98, miR-10/100, miR-125, miR-196, miR-199, miR-615-3p, mir-22-3p, mir-24-3p, mir-27a-3p, mir-193b-5p, mir-195-3p). Additionally, abundant small nuclear and nucleolar RNA were detected in PSCs, whereas Y- and tRNA were found in AT-MSCs. Identification of EV-miRNA and non-coding RNA signatures released by these stem cells will provide clues towards understanding their role in intracellular communications, and well as their roles in maintaining the stem cell niche.
Overall design: Small non-coding RNA profiles of extracellular vesicles derived from adipose tissue stromal/stem cells (AT-MSCs) and human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated by next-generation sequencing."
