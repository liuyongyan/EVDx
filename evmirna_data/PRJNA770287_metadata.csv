After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS (Dulbecco’s PBS, Sigma-Aldrich, Cod. D8537, lot RNBH3372), and 12 mL of RPMI medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS depleted of exosomes (Exo-FBS, SBI, Cod. EXO-FBS-250A-1, lot 161004-002), 1% A/A, and 1% amphotericin B was added. After 48 h, culture media were collected and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature (RT) to remove cellular debris. The supernatants were transferred into new sterile tubes, and the appropriate volume of the ExoQuick-TC exosome isolation reagent (SBI, Cod. EXOTC50-A) was added according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then the tubes were gently mixed until the separation between the two phases was no longer visible. The tubes were kept standing at 4°C overnight (O/N). The following day, the tubes were centrifuged first at 1,500 × g for 30 min and then at 1,500 × g for 5 min to ensure complete removal of the ExoQuick-TC solution. Last, exosome pellets were resuspended in 300 μL of PBS solution.",Small RNA-sequencing in primary breast fibroblasts treated and not-treated with breast cancer exosomes (human),"We report the application of small-RNA-sequencing technology for high-throughput profiling of  microRNAs in primary mammalian fibroblasts upon breast cancer-derived exosome treatment. We generated microRNA expression profile by obtaining 928(?) microRNA sequences diffrentially expressed between fibroblasts incubated with exosomes and with PBS (NT,negative control).  Among  14 (?) microRNAs significantly upregulated in primary fibroblasts after exosome treatment, we demonstrated that microRNA-185-5p, microRNA-652-5p, and microRNA-1246 were actively involved in fibroblasts functional activation, thus corroborating our initial hypothesis.
Overall design: Examination of miRNAs differentially expressed in fibroblasts treated with breast cancer exosomes compared to not-treated fibroblasts"
