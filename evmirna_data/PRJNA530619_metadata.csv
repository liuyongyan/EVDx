PRJNA530619,SRR8839813,sEV,Urine,Healthy donor,-,2019-04-03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31342628/,"Morning urine was collected and centrifuged (2000× g for 5 minutes) at 4°C, and then filtrated at 0.22 μm before being stored at −80°C. The exosomes were then isolated from the human urine samples. First, 50 mL of cell-free urine samples was thawed on ice. Thereafter, the samples were ultracentrifuged at 150 000 × g, overnight at 4°C. Next, the exosome pellets were washed in 11 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS), followed by a second step of ultracentrifugation at 150 000× g, at 4°C for 2 hours. The supernatant was discarded, and the pelleted exosomes were then re-suspended in 500 μL of TRIzol for RNA analysis or in 250 μL of lysis buffer (8 mol/L urea, 2.5% SDS, 5 mg/mL leupeptin, 1 mg/mL pepstatin and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride) for protein analysis. The exosomes used for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were re-suspended in 100 mL of PBS. 10 mL of this exosome sample was used for NanoSight LM10 (NanoSight Ltd.) analysis after Nano dilution 1:100 in PBS.",Urinary exosome miR-30c-5p as a biomarker of clear cell renal cell carcinoma that inhibits progression by targeting HSPA5 (human),"Exosome-derived miRNAs are regarded as biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of many human cancers. However, its function in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear. In this study, differentially expressed miRNAs from urinal exosomes were identified using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and verified using urine samples of ccRCC patients and healthy donors. Then the exosomes were analyzed in early-stage ccRCC patients, healthy individuals and patients suffering with other urinary system cancers. Afterwards, the target gene of the miRNA was detected. Its biological function was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that miR-30c-5p could be stably amplified. Its expression pattern was significantly different only between ccRCC patients and healthy control individuals, but not compared with that of other urinary system cancers, which indicated its ccRCC specificity. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-30c-5p inhibited ccRCC progression in vitro and in vivo. Heat shock Protein 5 (HSPA5) was found to be a direct target gene of miR-30c-5p. HSPA5 depletion caused by miR-30c-5p inhibition reversed the promoting effect of ccRCC growth. In conclusion, urinary exosomal miR-30c-5p acts as a potential diagnostic biomarker of early-stage ccRCC, and might modulate the expression of HSPA5, which is correlated with the progression of ccRCC.
Overall design: To study the expression pattern of exosomal miRNA in the samples from ccRCC patients and healthy control individuals, total RNA was first isolated from the urine exosomes. The contents of small RNAs in the exosomes of ccRCC patients and healthy control individuals were consistent. Afterwards, miRNAs were isolated from total RNA and next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to compare the urinary exosome miRNA expression pattern of ccRCC patients with that of healthy individuals. The samples were then analyzed using an ultra-sequencer Illumina HiSeq2500, a platform that can deliver high quality data. After quality controls and adapter elimination, only high quality reads were aligned using a mirDeep2 algorithm against the mirBase v21 database, for the identification and quantification of previously described miRNAs. In total, 126 miRNA species were identified."
