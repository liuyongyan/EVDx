Peripheral blood from all subjects was collected in tubes with separating gel and clot activator, and then centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were obtained and transferred to another clean tube and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) of 8% concentration was used to isolate exosomes from the serum 21. First, serum was thawed and centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to remove the cell debris and then filtrated through 0.22-μm filter to remove larger vesicles. And 900 μL serum was mixed with 300 μL PEG 6000 of 32% concentration and then kept at 4°C overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min. The protein-rich supernatants were discarded, and the exosome-rich pellets were resolved by 200 μL 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −80°C until use.",miRNA sequencing of serum exosomes from hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis patients (human),"Exosomal microRNAs have recently been studied as potential diagnostic marker for various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate serum exosomal microRNA profiles as HCC diagnostic marker. Transmission electron microscopy and western blot were used to identify serum exosomes. Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group. Three upregulated and two downregulated microRNAs were selected for qPCR analysis. The levels of selected microRNAs were normalized to Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 microRNA mimics. Serum exosomal level of miR-122, miR-148a, and miR-1246 were further analyzed and significantly higher in HCC than LC and normal control (NC) group (P<0.001), but not different from chronic hepatitis group(p>0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic perfromance of candidate microRNAs. Area under the curve (AUC) of miR-148a was 0.891 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.809-0.947] in discriminating HCC from LC, remarkably higher than alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (AUC: 0.712, 95 % CI: 0.607-0.803). Binary logistic regression was adpoted to establish the diagnostic model for discriminating HCC from LC. And the combination of miR-122, miR-148a and AFP increased the AUC to 0.931 (95% CI, 0.857-0.973), which can also be applied for distinguishing early HCC from LC. miR-122 was the best for differentiating HCC from NC (AUC: 0.990, 95% CI, 0.945-1.000). These data suggests that serum exosomal microRNAs signature or their combination with traditional biomarker may be used as a suitable peripheral screening tool for HCC.
Overall design: Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed serum exosomal microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group."

First, serum was thawed and centrifuged at 3000 g for 15 min to remove the cell debris and then filtrated through 0.22-μm filter to remove larger vesicles. And 900 μL serum was mixed with 300 μL PEG 6000 of 32% concentration and then kept at 4°C overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 30 min. The protein-rich supernatants were discarded, and the exosome-rich pellets were resolved by 200 μL 0.01 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at −80°C until use.",miRNA sequencing of serum exosomes from hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis patients (human),"Exosomal microRNAs have recently been studied as potential diagnostic marker for various malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate serum exosomal microRNA profiles as HCC diagnostic marker. Transmission electron microscopy and western blot were used to identify serum exosomes. Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group. Three upregulated and two downregulated microRNAs were selected for qPCR analysis. The levels of selected microRNAs were normalized to Caenorhabditis elegans miR-39 microRNA mimics. Serum exosomal level of miR-122, miR-148a, and miR-1246 were further analyzed and significantly higher in HCC than LC and normal control (NC) group (P<0.001), but not different from chronic hepatitis group(p>0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate diagnostic perfromance of candidate microRNAs. Area under the curve (AUC) of miR-148a was 0.891 [95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.809-0.947] in discriminating HCC from LC, remarkably higher than alpha fetoprotein (AFP) (AUC: 0.712, 95 % CI: 0.607-0.803). Binary logistic regression was adpoted to establish the diagnostic model for discriminating HCC from LC. And the combination of miR-122, miR-148a and AFP increased the AUC to 0.931 (95% CI, 0.857-0.973), which can also be applied for distinguishing early HCC from LC. miR-122 was the best for differentiating HCC from NC (AUC: 0.990, 95% CI, 0.945-1.000). These data suggests that serum exosomal microRNAs signature or their combination with traditional biomarker may be used as a suitable peripheral screening tool for HCC.
Overall design: Deep sequencing was performed to screen differentially expressed serum exosomal microRNAs between HCC (n=5) and liver cirrhosis (LC, n=5) group."
