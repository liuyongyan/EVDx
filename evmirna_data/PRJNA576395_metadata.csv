In addition, MVs were also isolated with the Total Exosome Isolation Kit (Life Technologies), using a modified version of the manufacturer’s protocol. Specifically, isochronic and heterochronic cultures were established with Exosome-depleted FBS Media Supplement (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Culture media collected on the 4th and 7th days were pelleted and supernatant transferred to another tube for further clarification at 2000 g for 30 min to remove residual cells and debris. The remaining supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and 0.5 volumes of Total MV Isolation reagent was added for overnight incubation at 4°C. The following day, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 h at 4°C to pellet the exosomes for subsequent nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) or long-term storage at −80°C.","Aged, Young and Restored Samples from Mobilized Peripheral Blood [miRNA] (human)","We report the miRNA expression in each CD34+ cells and their exosomes in mobilized peripheral blood in aged, young, and aged/young samples cocultured in transwell.  Restored samples refer to aged MPB co-cultured with young MPB in the transwell culture.
Overall design: miRNA sequencing on each cells and exosomes from aged, young, and restored samples to find differentially expressed miRNAs"
