PRJEB43153,ERR5319140,sEV,Cell line|Cell line/BCPAP|Thyroid gland,Thyroid carcinoma,Iodine-131 radiation,2023-02-18,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36556238/,-,Differential expression of circulating exosomal microRNAs in radioiodine refractory papillary thyroid carcinomas,Dedifferentiation of the PTC cell lines BCPAP and K1 was established by 131I pretreatment and verified by radioimmunoassay and Western blotting. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in exosomes from radioiodine refractory and parental cell lines. Those related to the Na+/I- symporter (NIS) were selected and validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in PTC patients with non-131I-avid metastases and those with 131I-avid metastases.
