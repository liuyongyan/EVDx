PRJNA664968,SRR12692325,sEV,Endometrial-derived mesenchymal stromal cells|Primary cell|Uterus,Healthy donor,-,2020-09-24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34830067/,"EV release was determined in the secretome samples after 10,000× g centrifugation for 1 h to remove large particles. The viable cell number was used as a normalizer for the EV release rate. To enrich the EV fraction of the secretomes, SEC was performed (Supplementary Figure S1). Briefly, 10 mL of Sepharose CL-2B (Thermo Scientific) was stacked into PS columns (Thermo Scientific), washed, and equilibrated with freshly filtered (0.22 µm) PBS. A volume of 0.5 mL of 10,000× g supernatants was loaded onto the column for fraction collection (0.5 mL per fraction and a total of 24 fractions were collected), which was started immediately using PBS as an elution buffer. EV-containing fractions 8–10 were pooled to homogenize the comparison between samples in further analyses. ",Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha synergistically enhance the immunomodulatory capacity of extracellular vesicles from Endometrial-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells,Extracellular vesicles from endometrial-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (EVendMSCs) (n=3) and from endometrial-derived MSCs primed with Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha (Interferon-gamma/TNF-alpha primed EVendMSCs) (n=3) were characterized by transcriptomic approach. miRNAs were isolated and sequenced by next generation sequencing to evaluate the differential expression between EVendMSCs and Interferon-gamma/TNF-alpha primed EVendMSCs. Interferon-gamma/TNF-alpha primed EVendMSCs may be an innovative therapeutic option in various inflammatory mediated-diseases.
