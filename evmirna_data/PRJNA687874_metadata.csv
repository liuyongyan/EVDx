Afterwards, carefully move the supernatant to a new centrifugal tube with centrifugation again at 10,000g at 4 °C for 45 min to remove the large vesicles. The supernatant was filtrated by a 0.45 μm filter membrane and the filtrate was collected. The filtrate was moved to a new centrifugal tube, and an overspeed rotor was selected for centrifugation at 4 °C and 100,000g for 70 min. The supernatant was removed and resuspended with 1 × PBS precooled by 10 mL. The overspeed rotor was selected and centrifuged again at 4 °C for 100,000g for 70 min. The supernatant was removed, and 100 μL precooled 1 × PBS was used for resuspend.",Identification of potential plasma biomarkers in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma-derived exosomes based on RNA sequencing (human),"Purpose：Early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is vital to improve the prognosis of these patients. However, early diagnosis of NPC is typically challenging.Therefore, we explored the roles and mechanisms of exosomes in plasma of patients with early-stage NPC.
Methods: Exosomes in plasma were extracted by ultra-high-speed centrifugation.Western blot and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to verify the purity of exosomes. The sequencing data (6 plasma samples from healthy volunteers vs. 6 NPC plasma samples) were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), DESeq2, gene ontology (GO), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and TargetScan. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were obtained from the dataset (GSE118720) downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. Additionally, the datasets downloaded from the GEO database (GSE12452, GSE13597, GSE53819, GSE64634) were used to predict the target genes and functions of hsa-miR-1301-3p. qPCR was applied to verify the differences in the expressions of hsa-miR-1301-3p between 10 normal plasma and 10 NPC plasma samples.
Results:Western blot, TEM, and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis showed adequate purity of the extracted exosomes. RNA-seq analysis revealed 21 upregulated miRNAs, and 10 downregulated miRNAs in plasma exosomes of early-stage NPC patients. GO analysis showed that the target genes of DEmiRNAs were mainly enriched in DNA synthesis and transcription regulation. KEGG analysis revealed that DEmiRNAs were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, the expression of hsa-mir-1301-3p was verified to be significantly upregulated in enlarged samples of plasma exosomes.
Conclusions:We identified several DEmiRNAs extracted from tumor-derived exosomes between normal plasma and early-stage NPC plasma. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that these DEmiRNAs may be related to NPC development. Our study may provide novel insights into underlying biomarkers and mechanisms of plasma exosomes in early-stage NPC.

Results:Western blot, TEM, and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis showed adequate purity of the extracted exosomes. RNA-seq analysis revealed 21 upregulated miRNAs, and 10 downregulated miRNAs in plasma exosomes of early-stage NPC patients. GO analysis showed that the target genes of DEmiRNAs were mainly enriched in DNA synthesis and transcription regulation. KEGG analysis revealed that DEmiRNAs were mainly enriched in PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. Moreover, the expression of hsa-mir-1301-3p was verified to be significantly upregulated in enlarged samples of plasma exosomes.
Conclusions:We identified several DEmiRNAs extracted from tumor-derived exosomes between normal plasma and early-stage NPC plasma. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that these DEmiRNAs may be related to NPC development. Our study may provide novel insights into underlying biomarkers and mechanisms of plasma exosomes in early-stage NPC.

Afterwards, carefully move the supernatant to a new centrifugal tube with centrifugation again at 10,000g at 4 °C for 45 min to remove the large vesicles. The supernatant was filtrated by a 0.45 μm filter membrane and the filtrate was collected. The filtrate was moved to a new centrifugal tube, and an overspeed rotor was selected for centrifugation at 4 °C and 100,000g for 70 min. The supernatant was removed and resuspended with 1 × PBS precooled by 10 mL. The overspeed rotor was selected and centrifuged again at 4 °C for 100,000g for 70 min. The supernatant was removed, and 100 μL precooled 1 × PBS was used for resuspend.",Identification of potential plasma biomarkers in early-stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma-derived exosomes based on RNA sequencing (human),"Purpose：Early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is vital to improve the prognosis of these patients. However, early diagnosis of NPC is typically challenging.Therefore, we explored the roles and mechanisms of exosomes in plasma of patients with early-stage NPC.
Methods: Exosomes in plasma were extracted by ultra-high-speed centrifugation.Western blot and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to verify the purity of exosomes. The sequencing data (6 plasma samples from healthy volunteers vs. 6 NPC plasma samples) were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA), DESeq2, gene ontology (GO), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), and TargetScan. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were obtained from the dataset (GSE118720) downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository. Additionally, the datasets downloaded from the GEO database (GSE12452, GSE13597, GSE53819, GSE64634) were used to predict the target genes and functions of hsa-miR-1301-3p. qPCR was applied to verify the differences in the expressions of hsa-miR-1301-3p between 10 normal plasma and 10 NPC plasma samples.
