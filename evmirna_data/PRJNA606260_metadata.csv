Size distribution of EVs was measured by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis with NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, United Kingdom).",Dysregulation of intercellular communication indicates cellular processes controlled by transcription factors involved in doxorubicin-induced long-term cardiotoxicity in cancer survivors (human),"Long-term side effects of doxorubicin include cardiotoxicity. Because studying transcriptional network alterations in human heart at early stages of cardiac dysfunction development is not feasible, in the present study, we used circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to obtain insight into cellular processes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors with a history of doxorubicin treatment. We showed that altered miRNA profiles in plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and particularly the distribution of miRNAs between the two compartments in ALL survivors are linked to cellular transcriptomic processes controlled by transcription factors involved in epigenetic regulation, oxidative stress response, senescence, fibrosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a phenomenon involved in organ injury, repair, and remodeling. These alterations could also be linked to cardiac complications and interindividual variability in cardiomyocyte response to doxorubicin. Thus, circulating miRNAs can indicate the possible molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity in patients previously exposed to anthracyclines even when there are no apparent clinical signs of heart dysfunction.
Overall design: Study was designed to compare non-coding RNA circulating in extracellular vesicles and plasma in 61 ALL survivors and 59 healthy controls."

Because studying transcriptional network alterations in human heart at early stages of cardiac dysfunction development is not feasible, in the present study, we used circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to obtain insight into cellular processes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors with a history of doxorubicin treatment. We showed that altered miRNA profiles in plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and particularly the distribution of miRNAs between the two compartments in ALL survivors are linked to cellular transcriptomic processes controlled by transcription factors involved in epigenetic regulation, oxidative stress response, senescence, fibrosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a phenomenon involved in organ injury, repair, and remodeling. These alterations could also be linked to cardiac complications and interindividual variability in cardiomyocyte response to doxorubicin. Thus, circulating miRNAs can indicate the possible molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity in patients previously exposed to anthracyclines even when there are no apparent clinical signs of heart dysfunction.
Overall design: Study was designed to compare non-coding RNA circulating in extracellular vesicles and plasma in 61 ALL survivors and 59 healthy controls."

Because studying transcriptional network alterations in human heart at early stages of cardiac dysfunction development is not feasible, in the present study, we used circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to obtain insight into cellular processes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors with a history of doxorubicin treatment. We showed that altered miRNA profiles in plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and particularly the distribution of miRNAs between the two compartments in ALL survivors are linked to cellular transcriptomic processes controlled by transcription factors involved in epigenetic regulation, oxidative stress response, senescence, fibrosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a phenomenon involved in organ injury, repair, and remodeling.

We showed that altered miRNA profiles in plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and particularly the distribution of miRNAs between the two compartments in ALL survivors are linked to cellular transcriptomic processes controlled by transcription factors involved in epigenetic regulation, oxidative stress response, senescence, fibrosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a phenomenon involved in organ injury, repair, and remodeling. These alterations could also be linked to cardiac complications and interindividual variability in cardiomyocyte response to doxorubicin. Thus, circulating miRNAs can indicate the possible molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity in patients previously exposed to anthracyclines even when there are no apparent clinical signs of heart dysfunction.

Because studying transcriptional network alterations in human heart at early stages of cardiac dysfunction development is not feasible, in the present study, we used circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to obtain insight into cellular processes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors with a history of doxorubicin treatment. We showed that altered miRNA profiles in plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and particularly the distribution of miRNAs between the two compartments in ALL survivors are linked to cellular transcriptomic processes controlled by transcription factors involved in epigenetic regulation, oxidative stress response, senescence, fibrosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a phenomenon involved in organ injury, repair, and remodeling. These alterations could also be linked to cardiac complications and interindividual variability in cardiomyocyte response to doxorubicin. Thus, circulating miRNAs can indicate the possible molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity in patients previously exposed to anthracyclines even when there are no apparent clinical signs of heart dysfunction.
Overall design: Study was designed to compare non-coding RNA circulating in extracellular vesicles and plasma in 61 ALL survivors and 59 healthy controls."

Because studying transcriptional network alterations in human heart at early stages of cardiac dysfunction development is not feasible, in the present study, we used circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to obtain insight into cellular processes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors with a history of doxorubicin treatment. We showed that altered miRNA profiles in plasma and circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) and particularly the distribution of miRNAs between the two compartments in ALL survivors are linked to cellular transcriptomic processes controlled by transcription factors involved in epigenetic regulation, oxidative stress response, senescence, fibrosis, or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a phenomenon involved in organ injury, repair, and remodeling. These alterations could also be linked to cardiac complications and interindividual variability in cardiomyocyte response to doxorubicin. Thus, circulating miRNAs can indicate the possible molecular mechanisms of cardiotoxicity in patients previously exposed to anthracyclines even when there are no apparent clinical signs of heart dysfunction.
Overall design: Study was designed to compare non-coding RNA circulating in extracellular vesicles and plasma in 61 ALL survivors and 59 healthy controls."
