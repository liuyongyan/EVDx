Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was stored at −20 °C until further use. sEVs were isolated by differential ultracentrifugation as previously described. Briefly, cells were pelleted at 200 g for 5 min and supernatant was centrifuged at 2000 x g for 15 min to remove dead cells and again at 16,000 × g for 45 min to remove cell debris, and supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22-µm filter and the flow-through was transferred to new tubes and then centrifuged again at 120,000 g for 70 min at 4 °C in a SW32Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Pasadena, CA) to pellet the sEVs. The supernatant was then filtered through a 0.22-µm filter, and the flow-through was transferred to new tubes and then centrifuged again at 120,000 g for 70 min at 4 °C in a SW32Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Pasadena, CA) to pellet the sEVs. The supernatant was also stored in other tubes as EV-free supernatant (EFS). The pellet was washed with 25 ml of PBS (without calcium or magnesium ions and with 1 U/μl RNAse inhibitor) and centrifuged again at 120,000 g for 70 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 100 μl of the same buffer and stored at −80 °C until further use.",MicroRNA profiling and analysis of primary OPLL cell derived exosomes (human),"In order to investigate the function and mechanism of Ossification of Posterior Longitudinal Ligament (OPLL)  primary ligament cell derived exosomes, we take advantages of high throughput sequencing technology to fully reveal the small RNA content of both OPLL and normal posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL) cell derived exosomes.
Overall design: We collect the posterior longitudinal ligament tissues of OPLL and PLL patients during surgery, PLL samples were collected from myelopathy patients who underwent ACCF operation. The collected samples were washed with PBS and subjected to primary culture immediately. The samples were  cut into small pieces and attached to culture flasks for primary culture, 10%FBS high-glucose DMEM were used as culture medium for primary ligament cell culture. When cells reach 80% confluent, the cell were lysed with trypsin for passage. After 2 passages, the primary cells were ready to perform exosome collection. For exosome collection, we use 1% exosome free FBS/DMEM for culture, the medium were collected at a 3-days interval, and the collected culture medium of both OPLL and PLL primary cell were subsequently subjected to ultracentrifugation. After the ultarcentrifugation, the pellet were washed with PBS and ultarcentrifugated again before use."
