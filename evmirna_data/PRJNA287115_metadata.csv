PRJNA287115,GSM1712353,sEV,Primary cell|human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs),-,-,2016-11-23,27496568 / 27388239,"Exosomes were extracted and purified according to previous protocols [39, 40]. Briefly, uMSCs were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, which was pretreated by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g overnight at 4°C to remove serum exosomes in T75 or T150 flasks. When cells reached 80% confluence (about 2–3 days), cell medium was harvested every other day. Cells in each flasks were continuously cultured for exosome collection for no more than 12 days. Cell supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 minutes. The supernatants were then filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane and ultracentrifuged at 120,000 g for 70 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were transferred to a new tube to undergo another ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g for 3 hours at 4°C to pellet the exosomes. The exosomes were resuspended in RNAase-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and quantified by measuring their protein contents using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences). uMSC-Exo generated from different donors were labeled individually and used in discrete experiments.

J Transl Med. 2015;13:308.",Homo sapiens (human),"Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles that were found in many biological fluids such as blood, urine, and cultured medium. Exosomes are small vesicles (approximately 100nm in diameter) that contain many functional molecules like cytokines, receptors and regulating RNAs. In this study, we found that uMSC-derived exosomes accelerates wound healing and reduce myoblast formation in vivo. In vitro study showed uMSC-exosomes specific microRNAs take major roles in inhibiting myoblast differentiation of fibroblast. MicroRNA sequencing of both uMSC- and HEK293T-derived exosomes revealed significant differences between these exosomes. Further infomatic and functional analysis showed that uMSC-exosomes specific microRNA-21, -23,-145, and -125b can target different components of TGF-β signaling which attenuates the expression of α-SMA in fibroblasts, thus inhibiting myoblast differentiation
Overall design: Exosomes were collected form cell culture medium by serial centrifugation and ultracentrifugation."
