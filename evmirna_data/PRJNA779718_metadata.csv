Briefly, plasma was mixed with binding buffer (XBP) and added to the exoEasy membrane affinity column for binding. After centrifugation, the flow-through was discarded and wash buffer (XWP) was added to the column to wash off nonspecifically retained materials. Subsequently, the spin column membrane was incubated with elution buffer (XE) for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to collect the eluted circulating small EVs.

Noerholm, PLoS ONE 10, e0136133 (2015).",EV-miRome-wide identification of noncoding RNAs for detecting metastatic colorectal cancer and monitoring the therapeutic response (human),"Molecular composition of circulating small extracellular vesicles (EVs) does not merely reflect the cells of origin, but also is enriched in specific biomolecules directly associated with the cellular transformation. Given their functional and clinical relevance, small EVs have emerged as a promising target among the liquid biopsy approaches for cancer detection. However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche.

Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche.

Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

Given their functional and clinical relevance, small EVs have emerged as a promising target among the liquid biopsy approaches for cancer detection. However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.
Overall design: In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)."

Given their functional and clinical relevance, small EVs have emerged as a promising target among the liquid biopsy approaches for cancer detection. However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche.

Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche.

From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.
Overall design: In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)."

Given their functional and clinical relevance, small EVs have emerged as a promising target among the liquid biopsy approaches for cancer detection. However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.
Overall design: In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)."

However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche.

Given their functional and clinical relevance, small EVs have emerged as a promising target among the liquid biopsy approaches for cancer detection. However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.

Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche. Our clinically-oriented delineation of the mCRC-associated circulating EV-miRomes revealed the functional significance of these liquid biopsy markers and further strengthen their translational potential in tumor therapeutic monitoring.
Overall design: In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)."

Briefly, plasma was mixed with binding buffer (XBP) and added to the exoEasy membrane affinity column for binding. After centrifugation, the flow-through was discarded and wash buffer (XWP) was added to the column to wash off nonspecifically retained materials. Subsequently, the spin column membrane was incubated with elution buffer (XE) for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to collect the eluted circulating small EVs.

Given their functional and clinical relevance, small EVs have emerged as a promising target among the liquid biopsy approaches for cancer detection. However, while most of the currently identified EV-miRs are only geared towards one-dimensional disease detection, their application for long-term tracking and treatment response monitoring has been largely elusive. In this study, we established and optimized a rapid, sensitive and robust liquid biopsy sampling method, and further used small RNA sequencing to comprehensively catalogue EV-miRomes in association with the progression and outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). By cross-comparison of EV-miRomes (n = 290) from multi-stage and longitundial cohorts, we uncovered 28 EV-miRs for detecting mCRC, and 131 EV-miRs for long-term monitoring of tumor size progression. Among these candidates, we further pinpointed a 15-EV-miR signature with dual detection and monitoring functions for mCRC. From this panel, EV-miR-320c was uncovered as a strong clinical marker – aside from its diagnostic power, its high expression has also been linked to lower overall survival and a greater likelihood of disease recurrence. Furthermore, target spectrum of this 15-EV-miR signature of mCRC suggested an involvement of small EVs in programming the mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) transition for distant localization of the metastasized cells and also in creating a tumor-favoring metastatic niche.
