Briefly, cellular debris was removed from the media by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min, 2000 × g for 10 min, and 10,000 × g for 30 min. EVs were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h using the Optima L-90K Ultracentrifuge and SW 32 Ti swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter). The EV pellet was resuspended in PBS or TriZol reagent and frozen at −80 °C until further analysis. EVs were not pooled for any experiments in these studies.",Reproductive tract extracellular vesicles are sufficient to transmit intergenerational stress and program neurodevelopment,"We report reproductive tract extracellular vesicles (EVs) transmit information regarding stress in the paternal environment to sperm, ultimately altering fetal development. Using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, we found that sperm incubated with EVs collected from stress-treated epididymal epithelial cells produced offspring with altered neurodevelopment and adult stress reactivity. Proteomic and transcriptomic assessment of these EVs showed dramatic changes in protein and miRNA content long after stress treatment had ended.
Overall design: Examination of 1) impact of chronic stress on mouse sperm microRNA content over time (1 vs 12 weeks post-stress), 2) impact of corticostrone on secreted EV microRNA content from DC2 cells over time (1, 4, 8 days post-treatment), 3) impact of intracytoplasmic sperm injection with sperm incubated with control or corticosterone-treated EVs on mouse E12.5 brain and 4) E12.5 placentas, 5) impact of perceived stress dynamic on human sperm over 6 months"
