PRJNA510806,SRR8354353,sEV,Blood|Serum,Healthy donor,-,2019-05-28,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31191492/,"We isolated the serum exosomes as previously described (Lv et al., 2017). We first performed differential centrifugation (1000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and 16,500 g for 30 min at 4°C) to remove the cell debris, followed by ultrafiltration using 0.22 μm filters. We then performed ultracentrifugation (120,000 g for 2 h) to obtain exosome pellets.",Small RNA Profiles of Serum Exosomes Derived from Individuals with Latent and Active Tuberculosis (human),"We performed small RNA sequencing to explore small RNA profiles of serum exosomes derived from LTBI and TB patients and healthy controls (HC). Our results revealed distinct miRNA profile of the exosomes from the three samples. We identified many differentially expressed miRNAs, including some specifically expressed miRNAs in the three samples. Besides the specially expressed miRNAs, we demonstrated distinct expression panels of the serum exosomal miRNAs from LTBI and TB samples, and six expression patterns among the three samples. These specifically expressed miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs in different panels and patterns provide potential biomarkers for detection/diagnosis of latent and active TB using exosomal miRNAs. Additionally, we also discovered plenty of small RNAs derived from genomic repetitive sequences (e.g., SINEs, LINEs and LTR), which might play roles in host immune responses along with Mtb infection progresses. Overall, our findings provide important reference and improved understanding about miRNAs and repetitive region-derived small RNAs in exosome during Mtb infectious process, and facilitate the development of potential molecular targets for detection/diagnosis of latent and active tuberculosis.
Overall design: Examined three samples"
