Methods: Total RNA was isolated from plasma exosomes obtained from Ugandan patients with different viral status. A small RNA fraction was gel purified and was used to make sequencing libraries. At least 14 million read sequences were obtained from each library. Non-redondant sequences were then aligned to genomic (hg19) and and mRNA sequence (hg19) using bowtie 2; sequences with perfect-match and 1bp mismatch alignments were retained for further analysis using DEseq2
Methods: Total RNA was isolated from plasma obtained from KSHV-infected patients with or without HIV co-infection. A small RNA fraction was gel purified and was used to make sequencing libraries. At least 14 million read sequences were obtained from each library. Non-redondant sequences were then aligned to genomic (hg19) and and mRNA sequence (hg19) using bowtie 2; sequences with perfect-match and 1bp mismatch alignments were retained for further analysis using DEseq2
Results:Plasma exosomes isolated from either KSHV-infected or KSHV/ HIV co-infected patients exposed to malaria are overwhelmingly populated with YRNAs instead of miRNAs
Results: KSHV oral sheeding correlated with the detection of a pro-tumorigenic cellualr miRNA profile in plasma. KSHV plasma viremia is associated with the detec tion of KSHV encoded miRNA in plasma
Conclusions: Ugandan patients exposed to Plasmodium falciparum show an unusual repertoire of small RNAs in plasma exosomes, as the exosomal RNA is mostly composed of small RNA from the YRNA biotype
Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of the small RNA biotypes present in plasma from KSHV infected and KSHV/HIV co-infected patients without clinical sign of KSHV associated malignancies.
Overall design: Examine:the small RNA expression repertoire in total RNA isolated from plasma exosomes obtained from KSHV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection
Examine the small RNA expression repertoire including miRNA in total RNA isolated from plasma obtained from KSHV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection"
