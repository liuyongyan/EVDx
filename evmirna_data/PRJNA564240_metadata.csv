PRJNA564240,SRR10078125,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Healthy donor,-,2020-04-14,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32245988/,"Before EV isolation, plasma was thawed at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C. For miRNA sequencing, EVs were purified by the miRCURY Exosome Isolation Kit – Serum and Plasma (Exiqon, Denmark) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Precipitation agent was added to 0.5 ml cleared plasma and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Precipitated EVs were then pelleted, resuspended in 0.3 ml Resuspension buffer and analysed by nano particle tracking analysis (NTA).","Blood flow-restricted resistance exercise (BFRE) alters the surface profile, miRNA cargo and functional impact of circulating extracellular vesicles (human)","In this study, we provide evidence that ischemic exercise, conducted as blood flow-restricted resistance exercise, promote changes in the micro-RNA cargo of circulating extracellular vesicles in healthy volunteers.
Overall design: Examination of miRNA changes in circulating extracellular vesicles before and 1 hour after blood flow restricted exercise."
