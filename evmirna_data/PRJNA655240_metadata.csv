Briefly, platelet-free plasma was centrifuged at 20,000× g for 1 h. The pellet was washed in 0.2 µm filter filtered 1X PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). The supernatant of LEVs was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and spun in an Optima MAX-TL Ultracentrifuge at 100,000× g for 1 h at 4 °C and SEVS pellet was washed with 1 mL of filtered 1X PBS. Western blot analysis for LEVs markers (Annexin V, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and for SEVs markers (Alix-Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA) were run to confirm LEVs and SEVs purity as we previously described.
