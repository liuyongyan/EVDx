PRJNA946800,SRR23922105,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Gastric cancer,Malignant,2023-10-12,https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.04.28.538562,-,Exosomal microRNA signature from plasma-derived extracellular vesicles in gastric cancer (human),"Extracellular vesicles are structures surrounded by a lipid bilayer that facilitate intercellular communication by transporting biomolecules. These vesicles are now commonly referred to as part of liquid biopsy. In this study, we examine the characterization of miRNAs found in extracellular vesicles from patients with both benign gastric diseases and gastric cancer. By studying these miRNAs, we aim to identify potential biomarkers for gastric cancer.
Overall design: We have extracted extracellular vesicles from patients with gastric cancer and benign gastric diseases. Then, we extracted the small RNAs with Qiagen's miRNeasy kit. The characterization of small RNAs in the vesicles was performed with BGI's Small RNA Sequencing services, which applies DNBSEQ™ sequencing technology platforms."
