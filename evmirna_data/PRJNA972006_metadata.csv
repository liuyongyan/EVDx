Total RNA was isolated from exosomes following the protocol of the exoRNeasy SerumKit (Qiagen, No. 77064, United States).",IDO1 overexpression significantly affects exosomal miRNA subsets derived from osteosarcoma and ordinary osteoblasts (human),"To investigate whether IDO1 participated in OS malignant progression through miRNA, we selected non-metastatic OS cell line (MG63), metastatic OS cell line (143B) and non-tumorigenic immortalized osteoblastic hFOB1.19 cell line as the research object. Over Expression cell lines are contructed and exosomal miRNAs from both control and OE cell lines are sequenced to find out the differences in expression in the exosomes secreted from IDO1 overexpressing and WT cells.
Overall design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for 143B, MG63and hFOB1.19 cells and their IDO1 OE derivatives."
