More specifically, serum samples were rapidly thawed at 37 °C and then transferred into new centrifuge tubes, followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Next, supernatants were carefully transferred into a new tubes and then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to further remove any larger vesicles. Afterwards, respective supernatants were filtered using a 0.45 μm filter membrane, and the filtrates were collected, placed into a new tubes and centrifuged at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C, using an ultracentrifuge equipped with overspeed rotor (Beckman Optima L-100XP). Subsequently, supernatants were discarded and respective pellets were resuspended in 10 mL of 1×pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded again and new pellets were resuspended in 50 μL of pre-cooled 1×PBS. For each sample, a total of 10 μL of exosomes were observed under an electron microscope, while another 10 μL of exosomes were utilized for size detection. The remaining exosome solutions were stored at −80 °C.",Expression Profile of Serum-related Exosomal miRNAs from Parathyroid Tumor (human),"Objective: The expression pattern of exosomal miRNAs derived from parathyroid tumor is still unknown. In the present work, we aimed to examine the differences on microRNA (miRNA) expression, present in serum exosomes, by comparing parathyroid carcinoma (PC) and parathyroid adenoma (PA).
Methods: MiRNA expression profile of serum exosomes, derived from 4 PC patients and 4 PA patients, were analyzed by next-generation sequencing technology. The differential expressions of target miRNAs were further verified in both serum exosomes and tissues of PC/PA patients by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Lastly, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to investigate the efficiency of target exosomal miRNAs in distinguishing PC patients from PA controls.
Results: Multiple differentially expressed miRNAs of serum exosomes were screened out by sequencing. Based on this screening, hsa-miR-146b-5p (p=0.0846), hsa-miR-27a-5p (p=0.0412), hsa-miR-93-5p (p=0.73), hsa-miR-381-3p (p=0.1239) and hsa-miR-134-5p (p=0.0694) were up-regulated in the serum exosomes of PC patients. These results were validated by qPCR, where the trend on differential miRNA expression was consistent with the sequencing results. Specifically, the expression of exosomal hsa-miR-27a-5p was able to clearly distinguish PC patients from PA controls, and related analysis indicated that the area under the ROC curve was 0.8594 (p=0.0157).
Conclusion: Here we present, for the first time, the miRNA expression profile of serum exosomes derived from PC patients. Based on this result, we presently suggest that the exosomal hsa-miR-27a-5p may serve as a putative tumor marker for preoperative identification of PC and PA subjects.
Overall design: A total of 25 PHPT patients, including 12 PC and 13 PA patients, were included in this study. 4 cases of specimens were randomly selected from the PC (2 males and 2 females) and PA (1 male and 3 females) groups for sequencing. The remaining specimens in the PC and PA groups, together with 8 NC, were utilized for verification and analysis."
