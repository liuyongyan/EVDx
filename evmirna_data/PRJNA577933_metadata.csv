Immediate before irradiation, the fresh culture media containing 2% exosome-depleted FBS were added.  Cell culture media were collected 24 hrs after irradiation and subjected to differential centrifugation for isolation of exosomes as previous described [10], including sequential centrifugation of 300g, 2,000g and 10,000g for removal of live and dead cells and cell debris, and ultracentrifugation of 100,000g twice for removal of contaminated proteins.  The pellets were then used for further analysis.

Cancer Lett. 2017;385:12–20.",Analysis of exosomal miRNAs upon irradiation in pancreatic cancer cells (human),"We used miRNA-seq and bioinformatics to analyze and annotate the expression profiles exosomal miRNAs in pancreatic cancer cells after radiation, compared with the unirradiated cells. A total of 481 miRNAs were identified, and 284 miRNAs were annotated in miRBase. There were 22 filtered differentially expressed miRNAs (9 for up-regulated and 13 for down-regulated, fold change > 2, p-value < 0.05). This study provides the results of exosomal miRNA change in pancreatic cancer cells after radiation.
