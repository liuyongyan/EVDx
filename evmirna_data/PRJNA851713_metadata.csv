PRJNA851713,SRR19779148,-,Primary cell|sensory neuron,-,-,2024-06-28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA851713/,-,Small RNA-seq analysis of exosomes derived from VZV-infected neurons (human),"Exosomes have emerged as essential extracellular signaling vesicles that can deliver proteins and nucleic acids to cells during normal and disease states. Herein, we studied the effects of exosomes produced by VZV-infected human sensory neurons on cerebrovascular cells. Exosomes were isolated from mock- and VZV-infected sensory neurons and protein and nucleic acid was determined by mass spectrometry and Next-Generation Sequencing. Subsequently, mock- and VZV-derived exosomes were applied to primary human brain vascular adventitial fibroblasts (HBVAFs). Overall, exosomes from VZV-infected sensory neurons impacted the pro-inflammatory phenotype of HBVAF cells. The presence of pathogenic exosomes that could circulate throughout the body provides insight into clinical infections.
Overall design: Exosomes derived from VZV- or MOCK-infected HD10 neurons were isolated in triplicate per condition and subject to small RNA-seq analysis."
