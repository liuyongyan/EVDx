Overall design: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were isolated from the umbilical cord and expanded in culture. MSCs and Medical Research Council cell strain 5 (MRC-5) cells were cultured in exosomes-free complete medium. We isolated exosomes from the cell culture supernatant. Then we compared the differential miRNA between Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes and MRC-5 cell-derived exosomes by using miRNA sequencing."
