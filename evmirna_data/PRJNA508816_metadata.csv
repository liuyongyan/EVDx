PRJNA508816,SRR8289653,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Breast cancer,-,2019-01-23,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30936474/,"EVs from tumour culture medium were isolated as previously described49. In brief, culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 3,000 r.p.m. for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by a centrifugation step of 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Next, the supernatant was filtered using a 0.22-μm filter. EVs were isolated using Exosome Precipitation Solution (ExoQuick-TC, System Biosciences) or ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Plasma EVs were collected using an ExoQuick Ultra EV Isolation kit for Serum and Plasma (EQULTRA-1, System Biosciences). Before plasma EV collection, plasma was treated with Thrombin Plasma prep for Exosome precipitation (TMEXO-1, System Biosciences).",Characterization of RNA context tumor associated macrophages and related extracellular vesicles [small RNA-seq] (human),"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane vesicles released by all cell types and contain proteins and non-coding RNAs, which are transported into recipient cells to regulate their signal transduction and functions. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that EV shuttling is an effective means of bio-molecule transportation among various cell types in the tumor microenvironment, and thus plays a critical role in regulating cancer cell biology. Previous studies have shown that TAMs are an important source of extracellular vesicles and the extracellular vesicles released by TAMs can promote the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. In this study, we studied the differential expression of TAM EV and the donor cells.
Overall design: Examination of small RNA-seq in TAMs and TAM EV (mixture from 10 donors)."
