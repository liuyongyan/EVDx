The pellets were washed with D-PBS, centrifuged similarly at 10,000 g for 40 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in PBS. To isolate sEVs, the CM supernatant from the previous centrifugation was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and centrifuged at 32,000 rpm using an SW32Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Inc., CA, USA) for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with PBS, centrifuged similarly at 32,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C, and resuspended in PBS.",Small RNA sequencing for leiomyosarcoma cells and their extracellular vesicles (human),"Uterine leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor and has a poor prognosis even during its early stages. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) carry cargo, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), which are involved in intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment and other processes. EVs are classified based on their biogenesis mechanism, and small EVs have a diameter of less than 200 nm, whereas medium/large EVs have a diameter of 200 nm or greater. This study investigated the expression of miRNAs in leiomyosarcoma cells and their EVs.
Overall design: SKN and SK-LMS-1 cells were cultured, and small and medium/large EVs were purified using the ultracentrifuge. Then, total RNA was extracted, and small RNA sequencing was performed."
