HT29-Snail 3, 8, 17 and HT29-pcDNA clones were grown to 70–80% confluence on 15-cm dishes, washed three times with empty medium to remove vesicles present in FBS of culture medium and then cultured for 24 h to obtain conditioned medium. Next the medium was collected and centrifuged (350× g for 10 min) to remove floating cells. The supernatants were then collected and centrifuged at 2000× g for 20 min to remove APOs. Finally, EVs pellets were obtained after ultra-centrifugation for 1.5 h at 100,000× g using OPTIMA L-80 Ultracentrifuge and Type 45 Ti Rotor, Fixed Angle (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The pellets were next washed by diluting in PBS and centrifuging for 1.5 h at 100,000× g. All centrifugations were performed at 4 °C. Finally, EVs pellets were resuspend in PBS for Western blots or in appropriate media for functional experiments.
