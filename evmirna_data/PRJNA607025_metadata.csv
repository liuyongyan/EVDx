According to the recommended protocol, 63 μL ExoQuick Solution (System Biosciences Inc., Mountain View, CA, United States) was added to every 250 μL serum and incubated at 4°C for 40 min after a brief up and down. After that, the ExoQuick/serum mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 g for 30 min, and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. Another 5 min centrifugation was performed to remove the residue liquid. Finally, the sEVs-containing pellet was resuspended in PBS.",a RNAseq study on serum exosomes from stroke patients,"a RNAseq study on serum exosomes from stroke patients ,with two healthy samples and two stroke patients ' samples."
