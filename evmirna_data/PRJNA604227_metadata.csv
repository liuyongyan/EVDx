Pre-cleared plasma (250 μl) was then mixed with an equal volume of thromboplastin D and incubated for 15 min at 37°C. Supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, mixed with 100 μl of ExoQuick (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, United States) and 6.25 μl of RNase (1 mg/ml), and incubated overnight at 4°C. Exosome-enriched preparations were spun down at 1,500 × g for 25 min at 4°C. Supernatants were then gently removed, and exosome-enriched pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of PBS with 1.25 μl of RNAse inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and stored at −20°C.",Sedentary and Trained Older Adults Have Distinct Circulating Exosomal microRNA Profiles at Baseline and in Response to Acute Exercise (human),"Exercise has multi-systemic benefits and attenuates the physiological impairments associated with aging. Emerging evidence suggests that circulating exosomes mediate some of the beneficial effects of exercise via the transfer of microRNAs between tissues. However, the impact of regular exercise and acute exercise on circulating exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) in older populations remains unknown. In the present study, we analyzed circulating exomiR expression in endurance-trained elderly men and age-matched sedentary males at baseline (Pre), immediately after a forty minute bout of aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer (Post), and three hours after this acute exercise (3hPost). Plasma exosomes were isolated, characterized, and exomiR levels were determined by sequencing. The effect of regular exercise on circulating exomiRs was assessed using paired t-tests of baseline expression levels in the trained and sedentary groups. The effect of acute exercise was determined by comparing baseline and post-training expression levels in each group. Regular exercise resulted in significantly increased baseline expression of three exomiRs (miR-486-5p, miR-215-5p, miR-941) and decreased expression of one exomiR (miR-151b). Acute exercise altered circulating exomiR expression in both groups. However, exomiRs regulated by acute exercise in the trained group (7 miRNAs at Post and 8 at 3hPost) were distinct from those in the sedentary group (9 at Post and 4 at 3hPost). Pathway analysis prediction and reported target validation experiments revealed that the majority of exercise-regulated exomiRs are targeting genes that are related to IGF-1 signaling, a pathway involved in exercise-induced muscle and cardiac hypertrophy. The immediately post-acute exercise exomiR signature in the trained group correlates with activation of IGF-1 signaling, whereas in the sedentary group it is associated with inhibition of IGF-1 signaling. These results suggest that training status may counteract age-related anabolic resistance by modulating circulating exomiR profiles both at baseline and in response to acute exercise.
Overall design: Sequencing was performed on circulating exosome-derived small RNA samples isolated from 10 elderly individuals (5 endurance-trained and 5 sedentary subjects) at 3 time points: before acute exercise (Pre), immediately after acute exercise (Post), and 3h after acute exercise (3hPost)."

The effect of acute exercise was determined by comparing baseline and post-training expression levels in each group. Regular exercise resulted in significantly increased baseline expression of three exomiRs (miR-486-5p, miR-215-5p, miR-941) and decreased expression of one exomiR (miR-151b). Acute exercise altered circulating exomiR expression in both groups. However, exomiRs regulated by acute exercise in the trained group (7 miRNAs at Post and 8 at 3hPost) were distinct from those in the sedentary group (9 at Post and 4 at 3hPost). Pathway analysis prediction and reported target validation experiments revealed that the majority of exercise-regulated exomiRs are targeting genes that are related to IGF-1 signaling, a pathway involved in exercise-induced muscle and cardiac hypertrophy. The immediately post-acute exercise exomiR signature in the trained group correlates with activation of IGF-1 signaling, whereas in the sedentary group it is associated with inhibition of IGF-1 signaling. These results suggest that training status may counteract age-related anabolic resistance by modulating circulating exomiR profiles both at baseline and in response to acute exercise.
Overall design: Sequencing was performed on circulating exosome-derived small RNA samples isolated from 10 elderly individuals (5 endurance-trained and 5 sedentary subjects) at 3 time points: before acute exercise (Pre), immediately after acute exercise (Post), and 3h after acute exercise (3hPost)."

Emerging evidence suggests that circulating exosomes mediate some of the beneficial effects of exercise via the transfer of microRNAs between tissues. However, the impact of regular exercise and acute exercise on circulating exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) in older populations remains unknown. In the present study, we analyzed circulating exomiR expression in endurance-trained elderly men and age-matched sedentary males at baseline (Pre), immediately after a forty minute bout of aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer (Post), and three hours after this acute exercise (3hPost). Plasma exosomes were isolated, characterized, and exomiR levels were determined by sequencing. The effect of regular exercise on circulating exomiRs was assessed using paired t-tests of baseline expression levels in the trained and sedentary groups. The effect of acute exercise was determined by comparing baseline and post-training expression levels in each group. Regular exercise resulted in significantly increased baseline expression of three exomiRs (miR-486-5p, miR-215-5p, miR-941) and decreased expression of one exomiR (miR-151b). Acute exercise altered circulating exomiR expression in both groups. However, exomiRs regulated by acute exercise in the trained group (7 miRNAs at Post and 8 at 3hPost) were distinct from those in the sedentary group (9 at Post and 4 at 3hPost). Pathway analysis prediction and reported target validation experiments revealed that the majority of exercise-regulated exomiRs are targeting genes that are related to IGF-1 signaling, a pathway involved in exercise-induced muscle and cardiac hypertrophy. The immediately post-acute exercise exomiR signature in the trained group correlates with activation of IGF-1 signaling, whereas in the sedentary group it is associated with inhibition of IGF-1 signaling. These results suggest that training status may counteract age-related anabolic resistance by modulating circulating exomiR profiles both at baseline and in response to acute exercise.
Overall design: Sequencing was performed on circulating exosome-derived small RNA samples isolated from 10 elderly individuals (5 endurance-trained and 5 sedentary subjects) at 3 time points: before acute exercise (Pre), immediately after acute exercise (Post), and 3h after acute exercise (3hPost)."

Pathway analysis prediction and reported target validation experiments revealed that the majority of exercise-regulated exomiRs are targeting genes that are related to IGF-1 signaling, a pathway involved in exercise-induced muscle and cardiac hypertrophy. The immediately post-acute exercise exomiR signature in the trained group correlates with activation of IGF-1 signaling, whereas in the sedentary group it is associated with inhibition of IGF-1 signaling. These results suggest that training status may counteract age-related anabolic resistance by modulating circulating exomiR profiles both at baseline and in response to acute exercise.
Overall design: Sequencing was performed on circulating exosome-derived small RNA samples isolated from 10 elderly individuals (5 endurance-trained and 5 sedentary subjects) at 3 time points: before acute exercise (Pre), immediately after acute exercise (Post), and 3h after acute exercise (3hPost)."
