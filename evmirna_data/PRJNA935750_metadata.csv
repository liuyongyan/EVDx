PRJNA935750,SRR23498929,sEV,Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)|Primary cell,-,TNF-alpha-stimulated,2023-07-24,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37575264/,-,MicroRNA expression in normal and inflamed endothelial cells derived exosomes. (human),"Exosomes research has been strongly promoted by the discovery of different classes of RNAs, mainly miRNAs, which are transfered to target cells and modulate various simgnaling pathways in target cells. Inflamed endothelial cells derived exosomes, acting as carriers for intercellular information exchange in atherosclerosis, are worthy of further research to investigate the disease pathophysiological mechanisms. This study aimed to investigate the differentially microRNA expression between normal and inflamed endothelial cells derived exosomes.
Overall design: Comparison of the microRNA expression  in normal endothelial cells derived exosomes and TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells derived exosomes"
