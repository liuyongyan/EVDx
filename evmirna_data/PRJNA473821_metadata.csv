PRJNA473821,GSM3165497,-,-,Colorectal cancer,-,2021-05-31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA473821/,-,miRNA profile in tissue and circulating exosomes obtained from patients with colorectal cancer at different stages (human),"The aim of this study was to use a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach to discover novel miRNAs to track the progression of colorectal cancer. A total of 28 patients were recruited for this study and 3 samples were taken from each patient (exosomes, cancer tissue and adjacent normal tissue). Susbequently, patients were randomly pooled into two groups based on the cancer stage e.g. 6 patients with stage 1 colorectal cancer were pooled into two groups randomly, with each group consisting of 3 patients. This was performed for exosomes and cancer tissue, but for adjacent normal tissue patients were pooled into a single group based on the cancer stage.
Overall design: miRNAs were profiled from tissues and exosomes using next generation seqeuencing (Illumina NextSeq 500 platform)."
