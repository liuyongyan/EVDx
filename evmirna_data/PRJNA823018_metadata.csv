Briefly, 1 mL of serum was pretreated with 3 mL of nuclease-free water and 100 μL of ExoC Buffer, and then 200 μL of slurry E was added to the serum mixture. The mixture was mixed well, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 420 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was discarded, and 200 μL of ExoR buffer was added to the slurry pellet, mixed well, and incubated. The pellet was resuspended in ExoR buffer at room temperature for 5 min. After the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 30 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred to a column in a new tube and centrifuged at 3800 × g for 1 min; the flow-through contained the purified exosomes.",Maternal Circulating Exosomal miR-185-5p as Non-invasive Biomarker for the Prediction of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss. (human),"Pregnancy losses usually happening suddenly and are irreversible, this study aims to find a predictive biomarker of the upcoming pregnancy loss. We collected serum exosomes from pregnant women prospectively from 6 to 8 weeks gestation and divided the patients into ongoing pregnancy (OP) group, sporadic pregnancy loss (SPL) group, and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) group according to the pregnancy progress and pregnancy history. Then we performed genome-wide miRNA expression profiling by small RNA sequencing to identify differences between patients who are going to lose pregnancy and who would not. The results showed there were 68 miRNAs differently expressed among three groups. When comparing RPL group with OP group, there was a set of 43 miRNAs differentially expressed including 25 miRNAs up-regulated in the RPL group and 18 miRNAs down-regulated. Compared SPL group with OP group, there was a set of 76 miRNAs differentially expressed including 24 miRNAs up-regulated in the SPL group and 52 miRNAs down-regulated. Moreover, we combined RPL group and SPL group into PL group, and then compared PL group with OP group, there were 81 miRNAs expressed differently while 60 were up-regulated and 21 were down-regulated. Our study found that there were significant differences in the expression levels of exosomal miRNAs in peripheral blood between patients who continued pregnancy and those who were about to miscarriage, suggesting that maternal peripheral blood exosomal miRNAs could be used as predictive molecular markers for miscarriage.

The supernatant was discarded, and 200 μL of ExoR buffer was added to the slurry pellet, mixed well, and incubated. The pellet was resuspended in ExoR buffer at room temperature for 5 min. After the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 30 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred to a column in a new tube and centrifuged at 3800 × g for 1 min; the flow-through contained the purified exosomes.",Maternal Circulating Exosomal miR-185-5p as Non-invasive Biomarker for the Prediction of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss. (human),"Pregnancy losses usually happening suddenly and are irreversible, this study aims to find a predictive biomarker of the upcoming pregnancy loss. We collected serum exosomes from pregnant women prospectively from 6 to 8 weeks gestation and divided the patients into ongoing pregnancy (OP) group, sporadic pregnancy loss (SPL) group, and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) group according to the pregnancy progress and pregnancy history. Then we performed genome-wide miRNA expression profiling by small RNA sequencing to identify differences between patients who are going to lose pregnancy and who would not. The results showed there were 68 miRNAs differently expressed among three groups. When comparing RPL group with OP group, there was a set of 43 miRNAs differentially expressed including 25 miRNAs up-regulated in the RPL group and 18 miRNAs down-regulated. Compared SPL group with OP group, there was a set of 76 miRNAs differentially expressed including 24 miRNAs up-regulated in the SPL group and 52 miRNAs down-regulated. Moreover, we combined RPL group and SPL group into PL group, and then compared PL group with OP group, there were 81 miRNAs expressed differently while 60 were up-regulated and 21 were down-regulated. Our study found that there were significant differences in the expression levels of exosomal miRNAs in peripheral blood between patients who continued pregnancy and those who were about to miscarriage, suggesting that maternal peripheral blood exosomal miRNAs could be used as predictive molecular markers for miscarriage.
