Briefly, 1 volume of buffer XBP was mixed with the pre-filtered plasma sample and added onto the exoEasy spin column. After centrifugation, the pelleted fraction was re-suspended in nuclease-free water for later analysis or subjected to RNA extraction immediately. All centrifugation steps were performed at 4°C.",Exosomal hsa-miR199a-3p promotes  proliferation and metastasis in  neuroblastoma (human),"To elucidate whether exosomal hsa-miR199a-3p plays a role in  neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, a miRNA-seq analysis on plasma exosomal miRNA from neuroblastoma patients and normal controls.
Overall design: miRNA-seq was performed in neuroblastoma patients and normal controls"
