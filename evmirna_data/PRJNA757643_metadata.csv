PRJNA757643,SRR15607233,sEV,Peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE)|peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE),-,type I peritoneal ultrafiltration failure,2021-08-28,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA757643/,-,MiRNA sequencing revealed differentially expressed exosomes miRNAs in PDE of patients with peritoneal ultrafiltration failure (human),"There are differential expressions of exosomal miRNAs in PDE of patients with peritoneal ultrafiltration failure. It may be related to the occurrence of peritoneal ultrafiltration failure by regulating the process of peritoneal fibrosis such as inflammation, angiogenesis, and EMT.
Overall design: Include 6 samples, 3 are exosomes of type I peritoneal ultrafiltration failure, another 3 are exosomes of controls with stable peritoneal function."
