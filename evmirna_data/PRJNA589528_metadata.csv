In brief, after the addition of recommended solutions A & B to the plasma/CM, the mixture was centrifuged to recover exosomes.",Integrative analysis of microRNAs and mRNAs in liver tissue and exosomes from blood of hepatitis C virus (HCV) related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patient to identify biomarker and regulators of HCC [Small RNA-Seq] (human),"Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is one of the major risk factor for the progressive development of end stage liver diseases including liver cirrhosis (LC) and HCC worldwide. A deep insight into the molecular mechanism of development and progression of liver fibrosis into cirrhosis and HCC following chronic HCV infection leads to characterization of multiple cellular processes and the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Small Non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are found to be the prime regulators of multiple cellular pathways. Next generation sequencing is now an emerging tool to identify genome wide altered sncRNAs which are either abundant or present in low copy in diseased condition. Using such tools several studies have identified myriads of differentially regulated miRNAs in HCV infected liver tissue by mapping to the annotated sequences in the miRNA database (miRbase). Our study attempted to identify the candidate miRNA and genes involved in HCV related HCC which has a potential to serve as diagnostic molecule as well as therapeutic target for HCC surveillance and management. In addition, considering our current knowledge about eukaryotic genomes and gene expression patterns there could be many more functional sncRNAs with low copy number yet to be discovered and characterized. We also explored this part to address the complexity of the pathogenesis and disease progression as well as the heterogeneity of the disease.
Overall design: Identify the candidate miRNAs involved in HCV-related HCC.
