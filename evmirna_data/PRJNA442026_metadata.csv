Briefly, samples were centrifuged at 300×g for 10 min, 2000×g for 10 min, and 12000×g for 20 min; 2000×g for 30 min, and 12000×g for 45 min to remove whole cells and debris for Cchorionic villous (V-)conditioned media. The resultant supernatant fluid was passed through a 0.22-μm sterile filter (Steritop™, Millipore, Billerica, MA, U.S.A.) and then centrifuged at 100000×g for 120 min (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Asheville, NC, U.S.A., Sorvall, SureSpin™ 630/36, tube angle: 900). The pellet was resuspended in PBS (500 µl, pH 7.4), layered on the top of a discontinuous iodixanol gradient containing 40% (w/v), 20% (w/v), 10% (w/v), and 5% (w/v) iodixanol solutions made by diluting a stock solution of OptiPrep™ (60% (w/v) aqueous iodixanol from Sigma–Aldrich) and centrifuged at 100000×g for 20 h. Twelve individual fractions were collected, diluted in PBS, and centrifuged at 100000×g for 2 h. Finally, the pellet for each fraction was resuspended in 50 µl of PBS and stored at −80°C.

Placenta 50, 60–69.",Human Placental Exosomes in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Carry a Specific Set of miRNAs Associated with Skeletal Muscle Insulin Sensitivity (human),"The objective of this study was to investigate whether placental exosomes in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) carries a specific set of miRNAs associated with skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. Exosomes were isolated from chorionic villi-conditioned media and plasma from normal and GDM pregnancies. A specific set of miRNAs was identified to be selectively enriched within exosomes when compared to their cells of origin indicating specific packaging of miRNAs into exosomes. In addition, miRNA expression varies in a consistent pattern in placenta, placental-derived exosomes, circulating exosomes and skeletal muscle in GDM.
Overall design: miRNAs were profiled from exosomes and tissues using next generation seqeuencing (Illumina NextSeq 500 platform)."
