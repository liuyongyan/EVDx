To achieve efficient recovery of EVs, the plasma samples were pretreated with thrombin (5 U/mL) to defibrinate the samples and then EVs were extracted from 250 µL of defibrinated plasma according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To confirm the presence and size of EVs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blotting were performed.",smallRNA-seq of human blood plasma and its extravesicullar fraction of MDS patients,"We investigated profiles of circulating sncRNAs in blood plasma of MDS patients to better understand MDS pathogenesis and to search specific RNAs applicable as potential biomarkers. Our data demonstrate that profile of circulating sncRNAs is specific in MDS and changes with the disease progression, providing rationale for potential clinical usefulness of plasma sncRNAs in MDS prognostication.

To confirm the presence and size of EVs, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blotting were performed.",smallRNA-seq of human blood plasma and its extravesicullar fraction of MDS patients,"We investigated profiles of circulating sncRNAs in blood plasma of MDS patients to better understand MDS pathogenesis and to search specific RNAs applicable as potential biomarkers. Our data demonstrate that profile of circulating sncRNAs is specific in MDS and changes with the disease progression, providing rationale for potential clinical usefulness of plasma sncRNAs in MDS prognostication. However, monitoring of sncRNA levels in total plasma or in its extravesicular fraction represent distinctive snapshots of the disease and one may not be replaced by another."
