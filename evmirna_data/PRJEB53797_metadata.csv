Three samples were processed for each group. The total RNA or purified sRNA fragment of the sample was extracted, and the 3 'and 5' connectors were successively connected to reverse transcription into cDNA, and then PCR amplification was performed.  Then the target fragment library was recovered by glue cutting, and the qualified library was sequenced. Clean reads obtained by sequencing were compared with all mature miRNA sequences in miRDeep2 and miRBase. v22 database to obtain the structure, length and other information of miRNA and calculate its expression level."
