EVs were re-suspended in PBS and stored at – 80 °C for further analysis.",Human  retinal   organoids release  extracellular vesicles  that  regulate  gene  expression in  target  human  retinal  progenitors,"Developing human retinal organoids and their EVs contain unique populations of small noncoding RNAs, including miRNA, piRNA and tRNA. The EV genetic cargo has functions  correlated  to  retinal  differentiation  and  development.  Retinal   organoid   EVs   educate multipotent retinal progenitor cell differentiation toward photoreceptor and ganglion cell fates.
