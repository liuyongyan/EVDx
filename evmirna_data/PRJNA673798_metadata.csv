We therefore investigated the association of microRNAs, which regulate gene expression, with the response to individual treatments, focusing on radiation, to both better understand the mechanisms involved in resistance and to find potential biomarkers. Intrinsic radiation resistance and chemotherapy drug resistance were assessed in 8 OAC cell lines, and miRNA expression profiling was performed via high throughput qPCR. miRNAs were discovered that were either uniquely associated with resistance to radiation, cisplatin, or 5-FU, or were common to 2 or all 3 of the treatments.  Target mRNA pathway analyses indicated several potential mechanisms of treatment resistance. miRNAs associated with the in-vitro treatment responses were then investigated for association with pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in pre-treatment serums of 39 patients with OAC. Hsa-miR-451a was associated uniquely with resistance to radiation treatment in the cell lines, and with the response to nCRT in patient serums. Inhibition of hsa-miR-451a in the radiation resistant OAC cell line OE19 increased radiosensitivity (Survival Fraction 73% vs. 87%, p=0.0003), and altered RNA expression.  Pathway analysis of effected small non-coding RNAs and corresponding mRNA targets suggest potential mechanisms of radiation resistance in OAC.

Intrinsic radiation resistance and chemotherapy drug resistance were assessed in 8 OAC cell lines, and miRNA expression profiling was performed via high throughput qPCR. miRNAs were discovered that were either uniquely associated with resistance to radiation, cisplatin, or 5-FU, or were common to 2 or all 3 of the treatments.  Target mRNA pathway analyses indicated several potential mechanisms of treatment resistance. miRNAs associated with the in-vitro treatment responses were then investigated for association with pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in pre-treatment serums of 39 patients with OAC. Hsa-miR-451a was associated uniquely with resistance to radiation treatment in the cell lines, and with the response to nCRT in patient serums. Inhibition of hsa-miR-451a in the radiation resistant OAC cell line OE19 increased radiosensitivity (Survival Fraction 73% vs. 87%, p=0.0003), and altered RNA expression.  Pathway analysis of effected small non-coding RNAs and corresponding mRNA targets suggest potential mechanisms of radiation resistance in OAC.
Overall design: 39 patients with locally advanced (no distant metastases) Oesophageal Adenocarcinoma who received a nCRT protocol that included radiation (41.4 Gy), carboplatin and paclitaxel."
PRJNA673798,SRR12964432,sEV,Blood|Serum,Oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC),-,2020-11-03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33255413/,"For small extracellular vesicle isolation, 1 mL aliquots of serum were retrieved, quick thawed, and centrifuged at 16,000× g at 4 °C for 30 min to exclude larger microparticles. 250 µL supernatant from each sample was then processed with an ExoQuickTM kit (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, United States; EXOQ20A-1) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were incubated with ExoQuickTM at 4 °C for 16 h. The pellet isolated from each sample was resuspended with 50 µL phosphate buffered saline (PBS). We have previously confirmed that pellets obtained from serum using ExoQuickTM contain particles consistent in size with exosomes (30–150 nm), using a Nanosight LM10 Nanoparticle Analysis System and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis Software (Nanosight Ltd., Malvern, United Kingdom) [28]. We refer to these as small EVs, as recommended in the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles 2018 Guidelines [103].

We therefore investigated the association of microRNAs, which regulate gene expression, with the response to individual treatments, focusing on radiation, to both better understand the mechanisms involved in resistance and to find potential biomarkers. Intrinsic radiation resistance and chemotherapy drug resistance were assessed in 8 OAC cell lines, and miRNA expression profiling was performed via high throughput qPCR. miRNAs were discovered that were either uniquely associated with resistance to radiation, cisplatin, or 5-FU, or were common to 2 or all 3 of the treatments.  Target mRNA pathway analyses indicated several potential mechanisms of treatment resistance. miRNAs associated with the in-vitro treatment responses were then investigated for association with pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in pre-treatment serums of 39 patients with OAC.
