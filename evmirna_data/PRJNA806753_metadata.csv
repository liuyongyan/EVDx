PRJNA806753,SRR18030414,sEV,Adipose|Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell|Primary cell,Healthy donor,-,2022-08-01,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA806753/,-,Homo sapiens (human),"Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is the most common type of hair loss in dermatology, also known as male alopecia. The prevalence of male alopecia in China was 19.9% and increased with age, which seriously affects the mental health and social image of patients. Its pathogenesis is mainly caused by the combination of DHT and androgen receptor. At present, only minoxidil and finasteride are approved by FDA to treat AGA, but hair loss will happen again after drug withdrawal. It is necessary to find a safe and effective treatment. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells have attracted extensive attention in the treatment of hair loss. As a kind of mesenchymal stem cells, adipose stem cells-derived-exosomes could promote the proliferation of dermal papilla cells. We found that the DPC pretreated with DHT could restored to normal growth level after co-incubation with exo. To further explore the mechanism, we sequenced the miRNA of ADSC exo. MiRNA in exosomes is an important component of paracrine signaling mediated intercellular communication and functional interaction. The purpose of our study was to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ADSC-Exo carrying miRNA antagonizing the inhibitory effect of DHT on hair follicle growth."
