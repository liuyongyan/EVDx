The supernatants were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Then, exosomes were collected by ultracentrifugation (Beckman, America) at 100,000 × g for 120 min. Finally, exosomes were washed in 12 ml PBS and collected again for 90 min. Exosomes were resuspended in PBS and protein concentration was measured by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Biosharp, China). For observation by transmission electron microscopy, exosomes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at 4°C overnight and then mounted on a copper grid, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and examined with a transmission electron microscope with 100 kV. For nanoparticle tracking analysis, exosomes were examined by Malvern Nano ZS90 as previously described (Shi et al., 2018). Exosomes were diluted in PBS and 1.0 ml suspension was loaded into a cuvette to measure and analyze.",NSC-derived exosomes enhance therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation on cerebral ischemia in mice (human),"Transplantation of neural stem cells (NSCs) has been proved to promote functional rehabilitation of brain lesions including ischemic stroke. However, the therapeutic effects of NSC transplantation is limited by the low survival and differentiation rates of NSCs due to the harsh environment in the brain after ischemic stroke. Here, we employed NSCs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) together with exosomes extracted from NSCs to treat cerebral ischemia induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) in mice. The results showed that NSC-derived exosomes significantly reduced the inflammatory response, alleviated oxidative stress after NSC transplantation, and facilitated NSCs differentiation in vivo. The combination of NSCs with exosomes ameliorated the injury of brain tissue including cerebral infarct, neuronal death and glial scarring, and promoted the motor function recovery. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of NSC-derived exosomes and the potential downstream genes. Our study provided the rationale for the clinical application of NSC-derived exosomes as a supportive adjuvant for NSC transplantation after stroke. 
Overall design: Eighty-eight MCAO/R mice were randomly divided into 4 groups at 7 days post operation, and twelve mice with low body weight (less than 15g) were excluded. Mice were anesthetized and placed in a mouse stereoscopic apparatus (RWD, China). The skull was drilled to make a burr hole above the lateral ventricle (AP+0, ML-1, DV-2.25 mm) for NSCs and exosomes injection. NSCs were genetically labeled with tdTomato for cell tracking. The five groups were treated as follows: Model (MCAO/R mice treated with 5 μL PBS), Exo (MCAO/R mice treated with 10 μg exosomes in 5 μL PBS), NSC (MCAO/R mice treated with 5×105 NSCs in 5 μL PBS), NSC+Exo (MCAO/R mice treated with 5×105 NSCs combine with 10 μg exosomes in 5 μL PBS) and Sham (fifteen mice with sham operation not treated). We did not perform high-throughput sequencing of all samples that participated in animal experiments."
