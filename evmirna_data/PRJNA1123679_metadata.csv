Although its aetiology was attributed to accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein species and subsequent loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, recently, systemic factors contributing to its initiation and progression have gained increasing recognition. Specifically, exosomes, a kind of extracellular vesicles in the size range of ∼30 to ∼200 nm, have been highlighted as crucial mediators in orchestrating the intricate intercellular communication in PD. Among its cargos, miRNAs, with its ability to promote target mRNA degradation and inihibit translation, have been identiifed as promising biomarkers and therpaeutic targets. Nonetheless, the effect of anti-parkinsonism medication on the serum exosome miRNA profiles of PD patients remain lagrely unexplored. Objective: To examine the effects of rasagiline, a potentially neuroprotective monoamine oxidase B inihibitor, on the serum exosome miRNA profile of PD patients.
Overall design: To investigate the effect of rasagilne on the serum exosome miRNA profiles of PD patients, we established four independent cohorts. Two cohorts included PD patients and healthy controls, while the others recorded data from PD patients before and after one year of rasagililne treatment."

Although its aetiology was attributed to accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein species and subsequent loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, recently, systemic factors contributing to its initiation and progression have gained increasing recognition. Specifically, exosomes, a kind of extracellular vesicles in the size range of ∼30 to ∼200 nm, have been highlighted as crucial mediators in orchestrating the intricate intercellular communication in PD. Among its cargos, miRNAs, with its ability to promote target mRNA degradation and inihibit translation, have been identiifed as promising biomarkers and therpaeutic targets. Nonetheless, the effect of anti-parkinsonism medication on the serum exosome miRNA profiles of PD patients remain lagrely unexplored.
