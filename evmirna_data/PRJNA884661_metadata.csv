After 48 h, the CM was collected and filtered through a 0.22 μm filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) to remove cells and cell debris, and exosomes were isolated by an exosome isolation kit (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, the appropriate volume of ExoQuick-TC Exosome Precipitation Solution was added to the CM and refrigerated overnight. The sample was centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for 30 min and then at 3000 r.p.m. for 5 min at 4 °C. Finally, the exosome pellet was resuspended in 1×PBS. Additionally, plasma exosomes were isolated using an exosome isolation kit (System Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The exosomes were quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay and stored at −80 °C for further experiments.",Differential expression of miRNAs in plasma exosomes between ESCC patients with lymph node metastasis(LNM+) and those without lymph node metastasis(LNM-) (human),"To identify the candidate exosomal miRNAs involved in ESCC metastasis, we conducted  small RNA sequencing to determine the miRNA expression profiles of plasma exosomes from 5 LNM+ and 5 LNM- ESCC patients
Overall design: Comparative the exosomal miRNA profiles of plasma from 10 ESCC patients with or without LNM"
