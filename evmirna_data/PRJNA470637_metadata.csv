PRJNA470637,SRR7138585,sEV,Cell line|Cell line/HeLa|Lung,Cervical cancer,-,2019-03-05,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30775228/,"Cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% FBS with exosome depleted by overnight centrifugation at 100 000 g. Medium was collected after the cells were cultured for 20 h or indicated time and subjected to centrifugation at 320 g for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 2 000 g for 15 min to remove debris and dead cells. The medium was further centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min at 4 °C (Beckman Coulter Optima L-100 XP, Beckman Coulter). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100 000 g for 70 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet, which contained exosomes, was washed once in PBS and collected by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 70 min.",Exosome release is regulated by mTORC1 via a Rab27A-dependent mechanism (human),"Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles released into extracellular spaces by many types of cells. These nanovesicles carry proteins, mRNA and miRNA and are involved in cell waste management and intercellular communication. In the present study we show that exosome release, which leads to net loss of cellular membrane and protein content, is negatively regulated by mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). We find that in cells and animal models exosome release is inhibited by sustained activation of mTORC1, leading to intracellular accumulation of CD63-positive exosome precursors. Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or nutrient and growth factor deprivation stimulates exosome release, which occurs concomitantly with autophagy. The drug-stimulated release is blocked by siRNA-mediated downregulation of small GTPase Rab27A. Analysis of the cargo content in exosomes released from rapamycin treated cells reveals that inhibition of mTORC1 does not alter its protein and miRNA profiles. These observations demonstrate that exosome release, like autophagy, is negatively regulated by mTORC1 in response to changes in nutrient and growth factor conditions
Overall design: Examination of 2 different microRNA expressions on rapamycin (Rapa) or mock treated (Ctrl) cells"
