Following the removal of cellular debris through centrifugation at 430 × g, approximately 1 mL of each FF sample was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C to eliminate medium and large-sized EVs using a Kubota Model 7000 centrifuge (KUBOTA Co., Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 µm filter (Millex-GV 33 mm, Millipore) and then ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C using an MLS50 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA). The pellet was washed with PBS, ultracentrifuged under the same conditions, and resuspended in PBS to extract the small EVs (sEVs).",Small RNA profiles of follicular fluid-derived small extracellular vesicles (human),"Follicular fluid (FF) provides a complex and suitable environment for oocyte maturation and contains several molecules secreted from oocyte and granulosa, cumulus, and theca cells. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EV) exist in various body fluids and are known as the cargo of several mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs to communicate from cell to cell. In this study, we investigated the miRNA profiles of FF-derived EVs.
Overall design: EVs were isolated from FF by the serial centrifugation method, and small RNA sequencing was performed."

Following the removal of cellular debris through centrifugation at 430 × g, approximately 1 mL of each FF sample was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C to eliminate medium and large-sized EVs using a Kubota Model 7000 centrifuge (KUBOTA Co., Tokyo, Japan). The supernatant was filtered using a 0.22 µm filter (Millex-GV 33 mm, Millipore) and then ultracentrifuged at 110,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C using an MLS50 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., USA). The pellet was washed with PBS, ultracentrifuged under the same conditions, and resuspended in PBS to extract the small EVs (sEVs).",Small RNA profiles of follicular fluid-derived small extracellular vesicles (human),"Follicular fluid (FF) provides a complex and suitable environment for oocyte maturation and contains several molecules secreted from oocyte and granulosa, cumulus, and theca cells. In addition, extracellular vesicles (EV) exist in various body fluids and are known as the cargo of several mRNAs, proteins, and miRNAs to communicate from cell to cell. In this study, we investigated the miRNA profiles of FF-derived EVs.
Overall design: EVs were isolated from FF by the serial centrifugation method, and small RNA sequencing was performed."
