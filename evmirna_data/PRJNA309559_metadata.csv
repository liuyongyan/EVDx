PRJNA309559,SRR3493372,sEV,Cell line|Cell line/Cal-27 cell|Tongue,Tongue squamous cell carcinoma,-,2016-05-15,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26992424/,A total of 250 μL of serum or 10 mL of tissue culture media was mixed with ExoQuick exosome precipitation solution and exosome isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (SBI System Biosciences). ,Homo sapiens (human),Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors. Exosomes are now implicated in mediating interactions with the cellular environment. The goal of this study was to investigate the miRNA expression profiles of exosomes derived from normoxic and hypoxic oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.
