Conditioned media was prepared from approximately 1×107 cells grown at 70% confluency in T175 cell culture flasks. Cell cultures were washed two times using PBS followed by 72 hours incubation with 15 mL exosome-depleted medium at 37°C and 10% CO2. Exosome-depleted medium was obtained by subjecting the FBS to ultracentrifugation, 120,000 g for 12 hours, before adding it (10%) to DMEM or RPMI. Conditioned media was harvested and centrifuged for 30 min at 2,000 g and 4°C to remove detached cells and cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 7.5 ml of Total Exosome Isolation reagent was added and the mixture was incubated over night at 2°C. After incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 1h at 10,000 g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets consisting of extracellular vesicles were resuspended in 200 μl PBS.",Homo sapiens (human),"By the use of high-throughput sequencing, we determine the complete small RNA content in extracellular vesicles derived from nine breast cancer cell lines, MA-11, MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, AU565, HCC1428, MCF7, HCC1187, DU4475, HCC1569.

Cell cultures were washed two times using PBS followed by 72 hours incubation with 15 mL exosome-depleted medium at 37°C and 10% CO2. Exosome-depleted medium was obtained by subjecting the FBS to ultracentrifugation, 120,000 g for 12 hours, before adding it (10%) to DMEM or RPMI. Conditioned media was harvested and centrifuged for 30 min at 2,000 g and 4°C to remove detached cells and cell debris. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and 7.5 ml of Total Exosome Isolation reagent was added and the mixture was incubated over night at 2°C.
