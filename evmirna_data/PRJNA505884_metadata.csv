Pellet was collected, resuspended in PBS and spun again for 2 h at 4°C, 100,000 x g. Final pellet was resuspended in PBS, aliquoted and frozen at -80°C.",HIV Nef transfected HEK293T cell culture and HIV mock transfected HEK293T cell culture [miRNA] (human),"Purpose: Comparison of RNA-sequencing datasets obtained from exosomes of Nef-transfected and Mock-transfected HEK293T cells
Methods: Assessment of RNA content of exosomes produced by Nef-transfected HEK293T cells and and Mock-transfected HEK293T cells
Results: Differences in a set of microRNAs
Conclusions: Nef-transfection induces changes in the microRNA content of exosomes
