The EV-enriched fractions were collected. Subsequently, RNA was extracted from EVs by using the Plasma/Serum RNA Purification Mini Kit (Cat. 56100, Norgen Biotek, ON, Canada) as indicated in the manufacturer’s protocol. ",Identification of Predictive Factors in Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Through Extracellular Vesicle Analysis (human),"The goal of this study is to find a molecular signature that can predict response or resistance to Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel therapy in pancreatic cancer (PC), to aid treatment selection for each patient. To this end, we analyzed blood-derived extracellular vesicles (EV).
Overall design: EV analysis was performed on a cohort of 21 patients with PC (metastatic, locally advanced) (PCp). Samples were collected prior to first-line treatment (Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel). EVs were isolated from plasma by SEC. Then we analyzed the EV RNA cargo through RNA Seq technology."
