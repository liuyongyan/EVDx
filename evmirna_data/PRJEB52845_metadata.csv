PRJEB52845,ERR10658906,sEV,Brain,-,-,2023-04-04,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37107614/,-,characterization of Astrocyte EV surface and cargo,"Extracellular vesicles from Human adult cortical astrocytes from healthy donor were prepared for proteomics and RNA analysis using serial centrifugation. 
The aim of the study was to identify transmembrane protein and RNA cargo. RNA was isolated from total EVs directly or after treatment with Proteinase K and RNAse, using miRNEasy kit. RNA was also isolated from cells to determine which RNAs were preferentially secreted, either loosly associated with EVs or as internal cargo. Small RNA were sequenced using Qiagen miRNA-seq library kit. We compared miRNA, exonal RNA and unannotated RNA from cells and EVS."
