PRJNA692609,SRR13448161,sEV,Blood|Plasma,Healthy donor,-,2021-12-03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34306340/,"ExoEasy Maxi Kit (Qiagen) was used to separate exosomes from plasma and cell culture medium following the manufacturers’ protocol. The XBP buffer was added to the sample in equal volumes and mixed thoroughly. The sample/XBP buffer mixture was applied onto exoEasy spin column and centrifuged at 500 g for 1 minute. Next, the flow-through was discarded and the spin column was placed in the same collection tube. A total of 10 ml of XWP buffer was added on the column and centrifuge at 5000 g for 5 minutes to remove the residual volume in the spin column. Subsequently, all the flow-through from the collection tube was discarded and the spin column was transferred to a new collection tube. Then, 400 μl-1 ml of XE buffer was added to the membrane and incubated for 1 minute. Finally, the column was centrifuged at 500 g for 5 minutes and the elute collected.",circRNA-sequencing analysis of plasma exosomes in hepatocellular carcinoma (human),"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently the third leading cause of death worldwide and the most common type of primary liver cancer, finding noninvasive biomarkers for HCC diagnostic and prognostic are very urging. Previous genomic studies mainly focus on finding miRNA biomarkers for HCC. In this study, we focus on finding circRNA fragments suitable for serving as hcc biomarkers with plasma exosomal RNA-seq..
Overall design: RNA-seq of plasma exosomal RNA collected from HCC patients, healthy donors, each with 6 replicates"
