Stomatin is highly expressed in exosomes of different origin and is a promising candidate as an exosomal marker. J. Cell. Biochem. 2021, 122, 100–115.",miRNA content of EVs from different OC-associated biological fluids,"The objective of this study is to identify miRNAs associated with the development of ovarian cancer (OC) based on the transcriptome of extracellular vesicles isolated from OC-related biological fluids. Three types of biological fluids were used as sources of these vesicles: uterine aspirates from OC patients and healthy donors, malignant ascites from patients with advanced stages of OC, and conditioned media obtained from OC cells isolated from ascites and grown in short-term primary cultures in vitro."
