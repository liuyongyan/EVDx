Samples were centrifuged at 3000 X g for 10 min at 4°C followed by sequential filtrating of the supernatant through 1.2, 0.8, 0.45, and 0.2 μm filters (VWR®). Resultant filtrate was centrifuged at 16500 X g for 45 min at 4°C and supernatant was again filtered using 0.2 μm filter followed by centrifugation at 12000 X g for 70 min at 4°C to pellet exosomes. Exosome pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of 1X PBS. ",RNA-seq of breast milk-derived exosomes from type 1 diabetic mothers compared to healthy controls,"The breast milk plays a crucial role in shaping the initial intestinal microbiota and mucosal immunity of the infant. Interestingly, breastfeeding has proven to be protective against the early onset of immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Studies have shown that exosomes from human breast milk (HM) are enriched in immune-modulating miRNAs suggesting that exosomal miRNAs transferred to the infant could play a critical role in the development of the infant’s immune system. In this study, we extracted exosome exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) from breast milk  of type 1 diabetic and healthy lactating mothers, in order to identify any differences in the exomiR content between the two groups"

",RNA-seq of breast milk-derived exosomes from type 1 diabetic mothers compared to healthy controls,"The breast milk plays a crucial role in shaping the initial intestinal microbiota and mucosal immunity of the infant. Interestingly, breastfeeding has proven to be protective against the early onset of immune-mediated diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Studies have shown that exosomes from human breast milk (HM) are enriched in immune-modulating miRNAs suggesting that exosomal miRNAs transferred to the infant could play a critical role in the development of the infant’s immune system. In this study, we extracted exosome exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) from breast milk  of type 1 diabetic and healthy lactating mothers, in order to identify any differences in the exomiR content between the two groups"
