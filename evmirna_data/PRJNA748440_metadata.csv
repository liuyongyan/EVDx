The media was centrifuged at 100,000 g for 90 min at 4°C using the SW41Ti Rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) with 60% sucrose cushion. Interphase was collected and centrifuged again with the sucrose cushion at 110,000 g for 12 h at 4°C. The interphase enriched with exosomes was collected, washed, and pelleted with 1× PBS at 110,000 g for 2 h at 4°C. Pellet containing exosomes were resuspended in either RIPA buffer or Qiazol (Qiagen, Germany) for protein analysis or RNA extraction, respectively.",Genome-wide small RNA sequencing of proliferative and replicative senescent human vascular smooth muscle cells and exosomes (human),"We report high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs can compare the profiles between proliferative and replicative senescent human vascular smooth muscle cells and exosomes
Overall design: Examination of differentially expressed miRNAs of proliferative and replicative senescent hVSMCs and their exosomes."
