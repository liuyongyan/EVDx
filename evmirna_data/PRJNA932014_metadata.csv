Briefly, the plasma sample was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 30 min to eliminate shed microvesicles. Then, the supernatant was collected and filtered with a 0.22 μm membrane filter, centrifuged at 10,0000 g for 2 h, and washed with 1 × PBS. Finally, the exosomes were resuspended in 1 × PBS and stored at −80°C until further use.",Determine the differential miRNA levels in plasma exosomes of  methamphetamine addicts [miRNA-seq] (human),"To determine the differential miRNA levels in methamphetamine addicts, we comparatively profiled plasma exosome miRNA expression of methamphetamine abusers and healthy controls using miRNA sequencing
Overall design: Plasma exosome miRNA expression of 5 methamphetamine abusers and 5 healthy controls"
