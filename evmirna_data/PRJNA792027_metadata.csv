For NTA, a 1/100 dilution of the EV suspension was analyzed in the Nanosight NS-300 instrument to obtain the average number of particles and the size distribution plot. Based on the NTA results, approximately equal concentration of control and TNFα EVs (1.8x1010 particles/ml) were used for each experiment.",human Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles miRNA sequencing,human Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived small extracellular vesicles miRNA sequencing
