However, there is no standardized protocol for profiling RNA in saliva EV nor clear guideline on selecting saliva fractions for biomarker analysis. To address these issues, we established a robust protocol for small RNA profiling from fractionated saliva. With this method, we performed comprehensive small RNA sequencing of four saliva fractions, including cell-free saliva (CFS), EV-depleted saliva (EV-D), exosome (EXO), and microvesicle (MV) from ten healthy volunteers.

In brief, CFS was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 hr at 4°C to pellet MVs. The MV-free supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 hr at 4°C to pellet EXOs.",Characteristics of Human and Microbiome RNA Profiles in Saliva (human),"Saliva is a convenient non-invasive source of liquid biopsy to monitor human health and diagnose diseases. In particular, extracellular vesicles (EVs) in saliva can potentially reveal clinically relevant information for systemic health. Recent studies have shown that RNA in saliva EVs could be exploited as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. However, there is no standardized protocol for profiling RNA in saliva EV nor clear guideline on selecting saliva fractions for biomarker analysis. To address these issues, we established a robust protocol for small RNA profiling from fractionated saliva. With this method, we performed comprehensive small RNA sequencing of four saliva fractions, including cell-free saliva (CFS), EV-depleted saliva (EV-D), exosome (EXO), and microvesicle (MV) from ten healthy volunteers.
